==Website: The Max Headroom Chronicles==
&lt;div style="float:right;margin: 5px 2px 10px 20px;&gt;{{MaxClock}}&lt;/div&gt;
This site represents the third evolution of a project that was begun in 2006. The development of this site began as a replacement for an earlier fan site by a prior owner and was developed in HTML and CSS.

When it became clear that the structured links of the proto-wiki site design were becoming too difficult to manage, the project was moved to a very powerful wiki platform. After substantial development, it proved that the chosen platform was a tremendous resource hog and was going to max out server space and boost user bandwidth usage. So the replacement site was pulled down and the slightly dusty HTML site put back up in its stead.

With the 30th anniversary of Max's debut on us, the project was started anew using this wiki platform. (I find it amusing to imagine Max saying "Wiki. W-w-wiki. Rhymes with... iki, right? R-r-r-right?") The power and flexibility of the MediaWiki platform have been a technological blessing, and have advanced the project more in the last year than in the first six months, never mind the following seven or eight years.

&lt;div class="redirectbox"&gt;
==The Original Site==
You might find &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt; [http://www.maxheadroom.com/OldMHSite/mh_home.html '''the original HTML site''']&lt;/span&gt; worth a quick look. I am very proud of the retro/era look, which I hope to replicate - mostly - some day on this more modern platform.

: '''&lt;span class="textpulse"&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/span&gt; If you've been redirected to this page from an outside or search link, be aware that nearly all the material you might be looking for can be found here on the new site, in both updated and easier-to-access form.''' (The interim site that was hosted on another wiki platform and included forums is no longer extant. Sorry. It's for the best, really.)
&lt;/div&gt;

==Project: The Max Headroom, ''er''... Project==
[[File:mhcom_cobb_wasteland.jpg|right|frame|I had always wondered if this Ron Cobb cartoon from the early 1970s (a favorite of mine since I first saw it) was an influence on any of the Max Headroom creative team. (Cobb worked on the art teams of many Hollywood sf and fantasy productions from 1981 to 2000 or so, so it was not an impossibility.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got word from George Stone that a framed print hung over his desk well before and into the Max era.]]
This website, the Max Headroom Chronicles, is the public face of a larger effort known as the Max Headroom Project. The Project has been going on for well over a decade as my interests in Max as a cultural icon and influence have pursued the subject into a variety of nooks and crannies.

Much of what I've discovered and acquired in this pursuit will one day appear here on the site. That which doesn't... well, I believe there are some important things to be said about Max's impact on our world, as brief as his reign was. Those things remain to be said, by me or someone I hope to work with or influence.

The site - the Chronicles - are the primary focus. As for the rest... stay tu-tuned.

===The MaxRchives===
Readers browsing the site will find a number of references to "the MaxRchives" and it was brought to my attention a little while back that the corresponding explanation hadn't yet found its way here.

The Max Headroom Archives - MaxRchives - are the holdings of physical, digital and intellectual property by the Max Headroom Project, and are available only by direct query and our ability to answer questions and provide excerpts within research and "fair use" guidelines. The material we can post here without annoying owners and rights holders is already posted, or will be, and we again thank those various parties for tolerating our use of this material and understanding our intent to remain "fair use" in practice while sometimes stretching that barrier to adequately document the material.

However, other rights owners are far more strict about even 30-35 year old publications and productions, and we thus have to hold that material back for individual use. If an item mentions it's in the MaxRchives, that notice serves two purposes. First, it means we really do have the item, have seen it, and the entry you're reading is based on first-hand evaluation and not a blog-of-a-blog-of-a-blog-of-a-fanzine "interpretation" of it. Second, it means you're free to make inquiries about the item, and we'll help as much as we can in answering questions, providing research material and guiding you to your own copy of that magazine, film, or other item.</ns0:text>

==Recent Update Log==
&lt;div style="float:right;margin:1px 1px 10px 20px;&gt;{{MaxClock}}&lt;/div&gt;
Entries are in reverse chronological order, and read from the most recent backwards.
* '''August 2016'''
** Forum and polls removed due to zero user participation.
* '''February 2016'''
** The [[MaxForum | Max Forum]] is now live. Talk your s-s-socks off!
* '''January 2016'''
** Quite a bit of fine-tuning to the styles, including the new active background. Please do let me know if the animations add up to "too much!" - I am aiming to keep the site visually interesting in a Max vibe, but without looking like some horror from the early days of the web.
** Created a long-overdue page about [[Max on Video|Max's various video releases]]. A good start, but it will be a long time in filling out with the last details.
* '''December 2015'''
** Plugged in an extension to allow responsive display for mobile devices. It's a start.
** Swapped out the fonts to get closer to that elusive retro-Max look. Also got the code for the Max Clock working under this platform.
** Adding a little more to the navigation, with "go to top" bars on the long pages, and duplicating the episode-to-episode bar at the bottom of all but the short episode listings.
** I think the dark theme is at the 99% adjusted point. Comments welcome.
** Switched over to the dark color scheme I've wanted since the beginning. Improved skill with the platform skin and the change to MonoBook brought it within reach. Lots of fine-tuning and fixes to do, though.
** Collapsed main InfoBanks table to reduce the number of entry links and pages, mostly in the Admin section.
** Added "Performers" section to [[Max: The Guests | Guests]] page.
** Major change to site skin (using MonoBook instead of Vector as the much-modified base).
** Updated YouTube links for both versions of Sting interview ([[Episode CH4.1.13]] and [[Episode CH4.2.1]] )
* '''November 2015'''
** ''' [[Max: Interviews &amp; Appearances#"Pixels" (2015) | BIG(gish) news in the Max appearance front!]]
** [[Season 1 Summary | A summary page has been created for the "lost" shows of the first season]]. The anchor of the page is a rare compilation of clips from this season, recently found on YouTube.
** Several of the third season show entries have been completed.
** Australia checks in with a pointer to [[Max: Advertising#Channel Four Digital (2007)|one more of the Channel 4 digital conversion ads]] and to a [[Max: Parodies#The Dingo Principle (April-June 1987)|Max-inspired political parody]]. Thanks, Andrew!
* '''5 August 2015 -''' Received a copy of the rare German translation of the telefilm book and  [[Der Deutsch Max#German Telefilm Book Translation (1989)|added an entry]] for it. Some associated rewrites on the same page.

==Some Notes About the New Site Design==
This is an evolving meta-discussion about what's happening here, where various parts of the site development are going, and what's planned for currently unfinished areas.

===1. Site Content===
The content of the old site has largely been transferred to this one. The current goal is to get as much new and basic information into this framework, including material that's years overdue for presentation. We're mostly there, although the last few shows continue to await time to complete the full documentation.

I am particularly proud of the overall "Shows" structure, which lists for the first time all Max Headroom shows, in their correct order, with verified air dates and increasingly complete information about show content. In all this, especially in re-establishing (possibly for the first time in the internet era) that there were three seasons of show produced by Channel Four, I am indebted to Simon Kelly.

The show listings themselves are increasingly complete - I have most of Season 3 still to fill out, all of Season 4 (Cinemax) and a few of the ABC series episodes. Getting there. It's slow, painstaking work and I do it amid other stuff.

===2. Site Organization===
The current site organization and navigation is increasingly finished, but is still subject to revision as the infobanks get closer to completion. I want to make it easy to browse and connect from one item to other relevant ones, but without linking every keyword in every paragraph - that gets distracting and counter-productive. I think I'm past major rearrangements now. The goal is an overall site structure that permits a natural, organic connection and cross-reference strategy - every "wiki walk" here should be a pleasant one.

Some of the index/cross-reference pages like Actors and Characters are still an incomplete mess, but others are approaching their final form and are hopefully interesting and useful.

===3. Site Design===
This site in no way resembles what I envision for the final look. The MediaWiki platform allows some style and design changes at a simple level, but resists the major reskinning that, say, WordPress has come to permit. So I am tinkering a little with the basic big-wiki look as I go, but expect to drop in one day and see a dramatic change - something, I hope, much like the old site but adapted to a modern platform and perhaps a little less aggressively retro. M-Max look... but not Max era.

And I like to think I'm getting there, despite the limitations of the platform. Judicious use of CSS animation has freshened up the look. I think. You?</ns0:text>

I am always interested in hearing from fans, admirers, the curious and anyone interested in the strange and wonderful phenomenon that is Max Headroom. I am particularly happy to help researchers and, here in Max's 30th anniversary year, writers, reporters and other media representatives.

Drop me a note any time.

::* &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[mailto:James%20Gifford%20&amp;#60;BigTimeTV@MaxHeadroom.com&amp;#62;?Subject=Live%20from%20the%20web%20site! BigTimeTV (at) MaxHeadroom.com]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Blank James&amp;#8221; Gifford&lt;br /&gt;The Max Headroom Project&lt;br /&gt;(High atop the Continental Divide these day)

&lt;span class="textpulse"&gt;'''PLEASE NOTE:'''&lt;/span&gt; I am ''not'' Max Headroom, Matt Frewer or any of the original creative team that brought Max to life. I have only a nodding acquaintance  with the current rights holders, and no power to grant permissions or usage rights of any kind. I can't get Max for your event or project.

I ''will'' be happy to help fans, researchers and admirers as much as I can with anything Max-related, but in the end, I'm the Zaphod Beeblebrox of the Max universe: ''I'm just ziss guy, you know?''


===Max's Rights &amp; Permissions Firewall===
If you're looking for rights or permissions, [[Credits &amp; Contributions#Copy, Trade &amp; Other -marks|start here]].

Do know, though, that the rights owner has not been found to be particularly accommodating to usage requests. I don't know of any "small" entity that's asked for permission to use Max material and received it. For that matter, I don't know of any large producer or would-be user that has, either. (The 2015 appearance of Max in the film "Pixels" is the only exception in decades, and I'm investigating the details.) The rights to Max IP seem to be too valuable to assign casually, but too small for the media conglomerate to want to bother with. It's frustrating, and I hope someone comes along soon with the right combination of project, funding and legal persistence to bring Max back to the world. God knows we need him.

Do let me know if you achieve any success in this direction, at all!</ns0:text>

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9896">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;In a rather delightful turn of events, I have discovered that what seemed to be a few loose ends of Max Headroom in German pop culture turn out to have been a significant aftershock to the US/UK Max era.&lt;/div&gt;

What may or may not have been a small number of producers and artists in northern Germany (in the Dusseldorf area) produced a significant body of Max-inspired and Max-related work, almost entirely in 1989. What's odd is that I don't know of any other translated or secondary works, other than a continuing amount of fan-fiction. Why the Germans latched onto Max (all the way through "Robert T-Online," more than ten years later) is hard to say, but it might have had something to do with Max's natural bond with techno music, which arose in part in the Dusseldorf nightclubs and bars in that era.

It occurs to me that at least some of the Max shows must have aired in Germany in this time frame - but which, and when, and even if are all unknowns at this time.

I'd love to hear from anyone who lived in Germany at that time and has a recollection of Max's intersection with German pop culture!

==German Telefilm Book Translation (1989)==
[[File:mhcom_max_headroom_picturebook_german_cover.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|The cover of the 1989 telefilm book translation.]]

This very rare book is a German  translation of the original novelization of the telefilm, written by Steve Roberts. It is standard mass-market paperback sized rather than the oversized format of the original, and includes one black and white photo every four or five pages.

It was translated by Thomas Ziegler and published in April, 1989.

&lt;span class="inlinecite"&gt;The MaxRchives contain a copy of this book.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both;margin: 10px 0 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==German Episode Novelizations (1989)==
Following the telefilm book above, a series of Max Headroom books were published in German in 1989. I have not finished tracking them down or translating the available descriptions, but they seem to be novelizations of early episodes. There appears to be four in the series, all by German sf author and comics writer Hajo Breuen, who died just last year. The four titles I have located so far include are all subtitled ''Das Buch zur Fernsehserie'' - "The Book of the Television Series" - and ''Die Neue Kultfigur'' - "The New Cult Figure."

Oddly, these and the picture book of the telefilm seem to be the only novelizations in any language. At least, that reached print.

&lt;div class="itembreak"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
[[File:mhcom_todliche-spots-cover.jpg|left|frame]]
====''Max Headroom. Tödliche Spots. Band 1.''====
("Max Headroom: Deadly Spots. Volume 1.")
: This appears to be a novelization of the telefilm or ABC pilot, "deadly spots" being the closest German translation of "blipverts."

&lt;span class="inlinecite"&gt;The MaxRchives contain a copy of this book.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="itembreak"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
[[File:mhcom_menschenjagd_cover.jpg|left|frame]]
====''Max Headroom. Menschenjagd. Band 2.''====

: ''There's a really freaky little personal connection here. The author, Hajo Breuen, was born in Dusseldorf and died (somewhat young, at just under 60) in nearby Munchen-Gladbach. I've visited Germany once, flying in to Dusseldorf to spend a few days with a client in... Munchen-Gladbach.''

==German Audio Performances (1989)==
In addition to the printed novelizations, a series of at least five "radio plays" or "audio re-performances" of ABC series episodes with a German cast were produced on cassette. For a time, the episodes were available on YouTube, but copyright violation complaints have caused their removal. At least they've been preserved in di-di-digital form...

==Techno/Club Dance Cuts &amp; Mixes==
These dance mix albums and cuts are very weird items, mostly in that the major labels that released them make no acknowledgement to Chrysalis Productions, Channel Four, ABC, Lorimar or any of the other then-current rights holders. I can only conclude that the Germans didn't care, the Brits no longer cared, or "rights" were as sloppily assigned by letter or memo as they had been from Chrysalis to Lorimar/ABC.

===MR. M.A.X.: ''Max Headroom Calling'' (1989)===
[[File:Mh-mr-max-cd-cover.jpg|right|300 px|border]]
This bizarre little gem turned up in a catalog search recently. It's a CD "maxi-single," also released on 12-inch vinyl in 1989 by Polydor. It's hard to tell what the title actually is, because the cover reads as shown - MR.M.A.X. / MAX HEADROOM CALLING - but the spine reads MR. M.A.X. / HIT THE BEAT MAX!, and the inside list has, sandwiched between cuts of those titles, one titled MAX TO THE RHYTHM DUB. The title cut is included here as a sample.

{| class="t_links_l maxhello"
|MR. M.A.X.: "Max Headroom Calling" (3:47)
|-
| &lt;html5media&gt;File:Mh-max-headroom-calling.mp3&lt;/html5media&gt;
|}

It is definitely a commercially-produced product by Polydor (offset-printed sleeve, smooth-edged pressed CD, all details such as catalog number and bar code)... but there is no copyright information except for Polydor.

Which is sensible, as this disc has nothing to do with Max Headroom except for having borrowed the name and a famous image. The cuts are strictly run-of-the-mill techno/club mixes, and while the female vocalists repeatedly call (for/out) "Max Headroom," the "Max" lines are done by a ''very'' bad impersonator with a pronounced German accent.

===Max Headroom: ''Mega Dance'' (1989)===
In the same time frame as the above single, a two-disc (vinyl and CD) dance mix album was released, headlined by the same MR. M.A.X. and appearing under the Max Headroom "brand."

&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Various-Max-Headroom-Mega-Dance/master/187272 A complete track and production listing]&lt;/span&gt; can be found at Discogs.com.

I suspect this is not a complete listing, but I will add to it as I find other examples of Max's brief, er, r-r-r-reich.</ns0:text>

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The entire Max Headroom saga began with a one-hour telefilm made for the UK's Channel Four.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives include a complete recording of this telefilm.''

The history of this production alone could fill many pages.

==Synopsis==
(Note: This synopsis is written to be completely "standalone" and is without reference to the very similar US pilot synopsis. For a comparison of the two shows, see the [[Max: Essays | Essays]] page.)

In a bleak, dystopian future where a downtrodden underclass is ruled by warring television networks and their advertisers, one tough investigative reporter, Edison Carter, strives to make a difference. He is one of the best-known on-air personalities, and "satellites globally" for what has long been the top-rated among thousands of television channels, Network 23.

Like all television reporters, he works solo with a	minicam linked back to the network via his base "controller." While in the field on a hot lead, the network	executives inexplicably can the story. His controller, Gorrister, commits the error of leaving him cut off and vulnerable in the field, and Carter punches him out on his battered return. Carter then demands a new controller, "the best," and "one he can trust," and gets "the best," the beautiful and skilled Theora Jones, hired away from	World 1.

When he tries to continue investigating the story, Carter is blocked at a high level. With Theora's skilled system cracking skills, he eventually learns that the Network 23 executives know something about the mysterious event, and confronts board member Ben Cheviot.

Then, with Theora's help, he breaks into the lab of Network 23's teenaged technical genius Bryce Lynch and discovers a secret "Rebus tape" that shows how a new form of compressed commercial, a "blipvert," designed by Lynch and exclusive to Network 23, causes extremely	slothful viewers to explode.

Grosman and most of the Network 23 board, driven by ratings and advertising revenue issues tied to their biggest advertiser, the powerful global corporation Zik-Zak, want the	profitable and compelling blipverts to continue, despite the risk.

While Carter is viewing the secret tape, Bryce Lynch sends two thugs, Breugal and Mahler, to capture him and he	is sent	running for his life. In an epic computer command battle between Bryce and Theora (one of the centerpiece scenes	of the movie), Lynch manages to force up an exit barrier that knocks Carter from	his speeding motorcycle. The last thing he sees before unconsciousness	is the clearance warning on the exit gate: '''Max Headroom 2.3m'''. Theora comes running to the rescue, but Carter, his camera and the motorcycle are gone, swept up by the thugs.

When it becomes critical to keep Carter on ice, Grosman allows Bryce to perform a cerebral scan of the unconscious Carter, transferring his memory into an AI program that theoretically could impersonate Carter on television. When the AI clone is started up, all it can remember at first is "Max... Max Headroom." Grosman is disappointed and angry; the simulation is far too crude to pass	for Carter.

To keep the secret of the Rebus tape and the blipvert problem, Grosman decides to have Carter disposed of and the useless "Max," with its copy of Carter's memories, hidden away. Lynch turns both of them over to the thugs, who deliver Carter to a "body bank," a wrecking yard for human parts, instead of killing him. Max, in a portable video unit, is delivered to Big Time Television, a pirate television network run from a huge battered pink bus.

Carter regains consciousness and escapes from the body bank, sending the thugs after him again. With Theora's help, he eludes them and hides in her apartment.

Meanwhile, the anchor, VJ and technical whiz - and burned-out ex-heavy metal fan - Blank Reg of Big Time Television has started Max up and discovered, to his and the (improbably elegant) network owner Dominique's delight, that Max is self-aware and interactive. Big Time's ratings soar within hours of putting Max on their broadcast.

Carter corners Bryce Lynch in his studio and leaves him tied up as the ratings surge of Big Time TV - and Grosman's recognition of Max thereon - causes chaos to erupt. Grosman pays the thugs to take him, Lynch and two network security goons to find Big Time TV, Max, and Carter. After Breugal and Mahler turn the goons into body parts, Carter appears and corners Grosman on live global TV to questions him about the blipvert problem. The final decision to go live with the story comes from Network 23 board member Ben Cheviot.

Grosman and Lynch are quite evidently out - perhaps even delivered to the body bank by Breugal and Mahler - Cheviot takes over Network 23, and Blank Reg and Dominique drive off into the hazy sunset with their new	ratings	booster, Max Headroom, on board. They knock one of its antennas off the bus as they pass under an underpass labeled... '''Max Headroom 4m'''.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
This telefilm was created to explain the origin and backstory of Max, who was conceived as a talking-head host and VJ for a British Channel 4 music program - sorry, programme. The ending of the film, with Max in the hands of Blank Reg and Big Time Television, was the final setup for Max's position as the music programme's host. The ending of the US remake is different, to better set up the series.

&lt;div class="redirectbox"&gt;
[[Episode CMX.0.1: The Extended Origin Telefilm | '''Extended Telefilm:]]''' There is also an 83-minute extended version of this film, created by Cinemax to introduce the new US talk and music show. It combines the original telefilm with about 25 minutes of extended Max riffs and introductions to videos, and then several complete videos as well. All of this material is apparently taken from the UK talk and music show and intended to more fully introduce Max and his show. A separate entry includes a complete listing of the new material and some additional quotes and screen captures.
&lt;/div&gt;

When Lorimar picked up the rights to continue the story as a series, they completely recast the show, keeping only Matt Frewer and Amanda Pays, with William Morgan Sheppard brought on in later episodes. Of the creative team, only producer Peter Wagg and writer Steve Roberts were brought over to the new show (a few of the special effects people were brought in as well).

The title of this production varies with the setting. The only title within the film is the opening "Max Headroom," but most promotional materials and the official "picture book of the film" extend it to "Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future."

It takes careful viewing to determine the city in which the story is set. A prominent computer generated map zooms in on the US, with a blinking dot near New Orleans. Close examination shows that this represents a satellite, and the footprint of the satellite is shown covering the southeastern US. The point of this is unclear, as the subsequent zoom onto Carter's position clearly shows it to be in or near London (a single-frame freeze is	needed to resolve the fast moving image). Is the earlier image intended to blur the location in viewer's minds?

The exploding viewer is captured on a "Rebus tape," which becomes a pivotal object in the story. It appears that "Rebus" was intended to represent the possibly secret "two way"	nature of the television system, whereby the networks can spy on viewers. Although viewers must be aware that the link is two-way sometimes - as for the "Dr. Duncan Show" - they may not be aware that it can be used all the time.	References in the series are to the "two way sampler."

Among the news summaries that flash past on Theora's console are:
* Whites should be permitted the same access to South African public areas as the majority population.
* Top secret prototype missile stolen from AKG by terrorists.
* Nuclear waste disposal space shuttle DMP.5 in difficulty over failed computer link; controller was watching the Polly Show at the time.
* Bolivian freedom fighters killed a 20-person medic team trying to reach starving peasants.
* Colonial USSR government in New Delhi ordered military suppression of food riots.
* Tokyo TV assembly workers threaten strike.

The Polly Show, also mentioned later as a possible Max-ratings killer, appears to be the most popular program on television.

Bryce Lynch's birthdate is given as October 7, 1988 (European style: 7/10/88). If his age is 18 or thereabouts, this places the story in 2006.

Theora's decoding of Bryce's door password is strictly Sherlock Holmes-style ratocination, unlike the technically assisted technique in the US remake.

Bryce's exit code is BZ2VH. His entry code is IJ2FI.

Theora says, "I know all about little boys." Carter turns it into an innuendo, but Theora clearly means something else. Is she referring to her younger brother, a subject not raised until the second US episode?

Breugal and Mahler are a riff on the 19th century Scottish body snatching team of Burke and Hare, who started off stealing newly buried bodies for physicians to use in anatomy lessons, and graduated to delivering still-warm corpses. (Mahler thinks this "has great potential.") Burke was hanged after Hare turned King's evidence. Hare died some 25 years later, a pauper.

Carter's personal ident code is 74928BDG6629.

The nurse receptionist at Nightingale's Body Bank is not identified by name. In the US remake, the joke is completed by calling the character (played by a nearly identical actress) "Florence." (Florence Nightingale? Famous nurse? Get it?)

The relationship between Blank Reg and Dominique (Blank Dominique?) is fuzzy (and remains so in the US series), but it can be discerned that it's Dom's business, and Reg is her unruly but necessary (for technical services) and popular (with Big Time's small audience) employee. Note, for example, Dominique's sour reaction when Reg introduces her to Max as "his partner," and her mention that he might get paid this month.

While chasing Carter the second time, Breugal quotes Shakespeare - Hamlet, to be precise: "Tis now the very witching time of night, when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes [out] contagion to this world..." Since they are hunting Carter to kill him this time, the unspoken completion of the line that's clearly on his mind is noteworthy: "...now could I drink hot blood, and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on."

The head of the network is listed in the end credits as "Grossman." In all other written references including the picture book novelization of the telefilm (written by teleplay author Steve Roberts), it's "Grosman." I have elected to use this latter spelling as the canonical one throughout the site contents.

While transporting Grosman and Bryce Lynch to "find Big Time TV," Mahler sings a creepy snippet of a song. &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/paul_evans/seven_little_girls_sitting_in_the_back_seat.html The complete lyrics can be found here], and a performance by the original artist can be found at the YouTube link at right.

William Morgan Sheppard, often credited as W. Morgan Sheppard or Morgan Sheppard, is miscredited as "Morgan Shepherd" in the final credits.

The two BBC channel references appear to be British viewer in-jokes. Channel 42, one of two "42" references in the show, is a nod to the contemporary "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

Edison Carter never encounters his AI alter-ego Max Headroom.

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Big Time Television: ratings, 1000... ratings, 1000."
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Dominique:&lt;/span&gt; "Reg, this is incredible... over a thousand viewers. You might get paid this month."
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Dominique:&lt;/span&gt; "What the hell is that?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Blank Reg:&lt;/span&gt; "His ratings?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Dominique:&lt;/span&gt; "You're kidding!"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Blank Reg:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, why not? Max Headroom, 2.3 million, well, that's what you want, idn'it?"
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Dominique:&lt;/span&gt; "...Max Headroom... he could have his own show!"
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "This is Max Headroom on Big Time Television, and what I want to know is: don't Eskimos ever get bored with their weather forecast?"
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "If you're all watching me, who's watching Network 23 - a network with a great future behind it? As they say when you're buying suppositories, with friends like those, who needs enemas?"
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Breugal:&lt;/span&gt; "Probably just a grilled microchip."
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Bryce:&lt;/span&gt; "Soon I'll be able to reconstruct anybody on the screen - so accurately that even your own Mum would know it was you."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Breugal:&lt;/span&gt; "You might care to call it the Phoenix, Mr. Bryce. My word, you could have all your politicians in little boxes. It's very handy."
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Cheviot:&lt;/span&gt; "It's only two percent."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Grosman:&lt;/span&gt; "Two percent is 26 million consumers, Ben! Once they start switching channels, it's war! You know that!"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Cheviot:&lt;/span&gt; "It happens all the time. We're used to it."
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Now, I understand why people prefer watching television to the radio. They've worked out how boring it is watching the radio."
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Murray:&lt;/span&gt; "What do I do, Ben?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Cheviot:&lt;/span&gt; "Do what you have to, Murray."
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Network Announcer:&lt;/span&gt; "We interrupt this programme for a special news flash. For the details, over now live and direct to Edison Carter."
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Carter:&lt;/span&gt; (on screen) "Tell me, sir, when did you first learn that blipverts caused people to spontaneously explode?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Blank Reg:&lt;/span&gt; "What a load of ''-click-'' bollocks!"
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I had to spend a little time recently with a parrot. (It's true.) I won't tell you why, but what amazes me is why anybody would want to spend any time at all sitting at home teaching a bird to talk - I mean, what's wrong with the rest of the family, huh? And of course they teach it something really interesting like, 'Who's a pretty boy'"
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Parrots are only one rung above politicians, though. You'll always know when they're lying: their lips move."

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;This crossover episode is the final one of the original Max Headroom video show, and featured a few video clips along with Max's introductions and riffs, but focused on his first interview, with Sting.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain a complete recording of this episode. There are also two badly-labeled clips on YouTube that make up the entire show as originally run on Channel Four.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* A bored couple argues in voiceover about Max and watching the show. ("His last"?)
* Announcer introduces Max.
* Opening riff by Max:
** Thank you (once or twenty times)
** It's time for the new game show, "Get Excited!" (Max introduces his lovely assistants, explains the rules and tells how the Excite-O-Graph will determine who goes on to the next round.)
** Max tells some golf jokes, followed by some Formula 1 jokes.
** "Isn't it amazing how things can go wrong? The best laid plans of Max and men..."
** Max announces his interview with Sting, who showed up at 7 a.m. at his home.
* (Commercial break - Clairol, Tennant's and In-Toto)
* Max explains how for 12 weeks he's been allowed into our homes, and now he's going to let us into his, to interview Sting.
* Max and his guest Sting talk about:
** His new, solo album ''The Dream of the Blue Turtles''
** Golf ("I hate golf, Max, you know this... it's an old man's game.")
** Jazz (Max yawns)
** Shoes
*** A break for Max to introduce and then show the Redskins video "Bring It Down" (with extensive interruptions and an early cut-away)
** Back to shoes - brown, not black (Sting hates black shoes)
** Getting political in songs
** On being 33
** Playing his songs in foreign countries where they might not understand the lyrics (like America)
** Back to shoes...
*** A break for a Max video riff about golf
** Discussion of Sting's hair style, which he says is a hair weave
** Max thanks Sting and gives him a memento... a pair of his very own golf shoes!
* Video clip: Backster's "Handclappin'," followed by a clip from Sid Vicious' cover of "My Way" in which he shoots at the audience.
* Max says it's been a damn great show and sings a song to that effect, segueing into a long closing riff about how great he is and how everyone will remember the show, and then back into the song.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
This show, part of the "lost" first season, would be re-used in large part for the first show of the second season, which would appear a few months later on Cinemax (possibly re-cut). There is more of the Sting interview to be seen in that repeat edit.

Max's comment that he's never had a guest "because he couldn't talk properly enough to have an intelligent conversation" is an inside reference to the problems of doing Max's stutters, repeats and visual shenanigans in realtime. With a solution found, Max could do these interviews - on his show, and with Terry Wogan and David Letterman.

==Quotes &amp; Caps==
[[File:MH-CH4-1-13_Max-with-Sting_320.jpg|right|frame]]
&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Male Viewer:&lt;/span&gt; "Whyn't you sit still and ''try'' to watch."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Female Viewer:&lt;/span&gt; "Watch what?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Male Viewer:&lt;/span&gt; "Max Headroom. It's his last show."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Female Viewer:&lt;/span&gt; "Oh, yeah? 'Oo's 'e?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Male Viewer:&lt;/span&gt; "Who's 'e! Well, 'e's this bloke. Well, sort of... well, he's sort of... well, 'alf and 'alf, if you know what I mean.
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Female Viewer:&lt;/span&gt; "Oh, yeah, sounds great."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Male Viewer:&lt;/span&gt; "All right, all right! If you must know, 'e's a computer-generated microcosm of the television age, incorporatin' a fusion of visual and verbal originality, to represent the in'erant diverse of the all-round TV personality. And  'e plays pop videos and all.
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Female Viewer:&lt;/span&gt; "Oh, that Max 'Eadroom."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Announcer:&lt;/span&gt; "Good morning, Sydney! Good afternoon, Los Angeles! Good evening, England! And it's the Max Headroom Show! Tonight on the show, it's more pop videos! Max gives away prizes, Max looks back, forward, and meets the stars with his old buddy Sting. He's turned down a Pro-Am golf tournament to be here with you all tonight, he's the man of the moment, his is Mr. TV himself... Max Headroom!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Oh-oh-oh-k-k-k-kay. For the last twelve weeks, you have been kind enough to allow little old ''moi'' into your home; now I'm going to let ''vous'' into mine. And so, ''ink-ga-da-dink-dink, dink-dink'', the Max Headroom Show takes a giant ''whit whit'' leap sideways onto my cocktail bar as I welcome - at last, ha ha - a guest on my show."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Sting... I want to thank you very much for coming on my show. And before you go, I'd like you to accept this... little... momento! [''sic''] A pair of my very own... golf shoes. (Sting groans) No, don't thank me..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Sting:&lt;/span&gt; "Couldn't you have given me a pair of tennis shoes?
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I don't have any tennis shoes. I've got 44 pairs of golf shoes and I'm giving you one pair of my golf shoes. Do you want them or not?
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Sting:&lt;/span&gt; "Um... yeah, I'll take 'em."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Atta boy! See..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Sting:&lt;/span&gt; "I'll exchange them for tennis shoes."

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The first Max Headroom show of the second season, with its new focus on guest interviews, featured a repeat of the Sting interview, but in a new edit.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain a complete recording of the Cinemax version of this episode. A clip of this version of the Sting interview, from the Channel Four broadcast, can be found on YouTube.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
(&lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;Colored text&lt;/span&gt; indicates material duplicated from the [[Episode CH4.1.13 | previous show]].)
* American announcer introduces Max.
* Max outlines the show, including the interview with... Stung!
* Video: Jean-Michel Jarre, "Zoolook" (robot clip version).

** Video: King Kurt, "Designation Zululand"
* M-M-Max takes a call-in order for Chinese food, introducing...
** Video: Japan, "Visions of China"
* &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;Max explains how for 12 weeks he's been allowed into our homes, and now he's going to let us into his, to interview Sting.&lt;/span&gt; (Previous-show reference omitted in Cinemax edit.)
* Max and his guest Sting talk about:
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;His new, solo album ''The Dream of the Blue Turtles''&lt;/span&gt;
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;Golf ("I hate golf, Max, you know this... it's an old man's game.")&lt;/span&gt;

*** A break to show a short video clip accompanying the stage recording of "Kinky Boots" (Patrick McNee and Honor Blackman), which continues in snips through the following topics.
** ...Sting wears size 7.5 shoes.
** Mark Knopfler (Sting sasses Max)
** ...but what kind of shoes? Sting says sandals (which leads to a "Christ figure" joke).
** Sting's appearance in the film ''The Bride''
*** ...with a side trip about sandals again.
** Tennis (in golf shoes on Sting's court)
*** A break to show the Sting video "If You Love Somebody Set Them Free."
** Sting bangs on the TV to wake Max up.
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;Discussion of Sting's hair style, which he says is a hair weave.&lt;/span&gt;
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;Max thanks Sting and gives him a memento... a pair of his very own golf shoes!&lt;/span&gt;
* Show's over; long Max riff on the guest star (himself) and the "crazy time" coming next time.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
The Cinemax rebroadcast used a different voiceover announcer to open the show, not used in the UK.

In the Channel Four version of this episode, Max's opening remarks of the Sting interview are reused from the prior show, including the internal reference to "the last twelve weeks" - which is anachronistic, as after that show, it would have been "the last ''thirteen'' weeks." Which is odd, as Max gives a completely new introduction near the beginning of the show... it seems the interview intro could have been updated as well. The Cinemax version shortens the introduction to remove the entire reference to a prior show. (The Channel Four version can be seen in the YouTube clip; the Cinemax version comes from the MaxRchives.)

The first part of the Sting interview is identical to what viewers would have seen just two weeks earlier, but then includes some new material towards the end.

==Quotes &amp; Caps==
[[File:MH-CH4-1-13_Max-with-Sting_320.jpg|right|frame]]
&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
''This introduction was used on all six episodes of Season 2.''
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;(Cinemax) Announcer:&lt;/span&gt; "He's the toast of the town, lightly buttered. He's the non-fattening sugar substitute in your tea. He's a ''bon vivant'', a ''gaucho amigo'', a goombah, a mensch and the fifth Musketeer. He's the apple of your eye and ''orange'' you glad he's here. Direct from a wax and shine at the car wash around the corner, it's the man of the hour (oh, for at least a good 30 minutes)... Max Headroom!"


(''Max's speech in these shows uses extreme stuttering and repetition, which I will not attempt to replicate in the transcriptions here. You can assume that any stutter noted goes on many times longer.'')
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I'm going to take over your T-T-TV. I'm gonna read the news, check the weather, talk about sports, meet the public, give away prizes, walk the dog, and play videos! videos! And don't forget, later in the show I'm gonna to be talking to the super-superstar with the five-star talent, and... the five-letter name. Yes! You guessed it... Stung! (reacts) Sting!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "...Yes, I ''do'' think you have the wrong 'Visions of China.' Okay, bye-bye-bye. ...What a shame, I was beginning to enjoy that. Well, it's like they say - you take one Chinese food order, and five minutes later you feel like another one."
&lt;/div&gt;

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
This episode is believed to have run third in the Channel Four series, despite being production number 2 and appearing on Cinemax in that order.

Max's opening quote about "making tomorrow seem like yesterday" was first spoken by Blank Reg in the [[Episode CH4.0.1: The Origin Telefilm | telefilm]]. His use of Edison Carter's catch line (and sometime show name) "What I want to know..." is also heard.

No unique visuals in this episode.

&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
(''Max's speech in these shows uses extreme stuttering and repetition, which I will not attempt to replicate in the transcriptions here. You can assume that any stutter noted goes on many times longer.'')
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Max-Max Head-Headroom, twenty-four hours a day after day after day, making tomorrow seem like yesterday."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You see, we've just had a telegram from the police-police in Texas, asking if we've seen a cow-cowboy answering this description: apparently he wears a brown paper hat, brown paper shirt, brown paper trousers and brown paper boots. They say he's wanted for rustling."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I got a joke. Okay, there was an Englishman, an Irishman-an Irishman and a Scotsman. And a Frenchman, and... an American. And a German. And I think an Australian as well. Okay. So there was this little Englishman Irishman Scotsman and American and German, and possibly an Australian, and I think they were in a bar. Heh. Ha... that's stupid, I've forgotten it."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Most people only eat revolting things to break a record. This lot did it to... make a record. 'Rats on a Budget'... Heat N Serve!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Everyone knows that frozen peas are as fresh as the moment the pod went ''pop''. But what about frozen meat... is that as fresh as the moment the cow went ''nnyeh nnyeh aaahh ayayayay-uhh''?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "What I want to know is, why aren't more people inventing useful things? Like Mr. Bob-Bob-Bobby Ashimura, who wins our Max Headroom product of the month award for coming out with a little attachment you plug into your TV and it warns you that the commercial break is coming, by automatically switching off your set for five seconds. And here to demonstrate it for us is Mr. Ashimura himself. (''Okay, Bob, take it away...'') (five seconds of static)

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "What would you do to help the world if you could spend 30,000 pounds a week for the next thhhh-ousand years? Well, that's how much the government are spending on Trident missiles. Don't facts like that just wipe you out? (sound of bowling roll and strike, leading to dancing taps) I know how to tap dance..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You know, I was walking around the city the other day, and it was so quiet you could have heard a window being smashed. It is strange, really. I suppose a lot of people are like windows. So many are... see-through. So many get smashed. And so many wander around with a glazed look over them. Are you like a window? Is your life a pane? Who was it said that..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You know, people can be really nasty. Only the other day I heard someone say, 'he's nothing but a robot, covered in makeup - talks a lot of nonsense.' What a way to talk about the President of America!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Don't forget, later on, I'll be talking to... Nick Kershaw on the telephone. So we'll all be looking forward to that. Now... if you gave an infinite number of monkeys a typewriter each for an infinite amount of time-time-time..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "(sobbing)...and I'd like to take this opportunity of thanking the one and only... (grins) Max Headroom, for giving you all such a wonderful time. So, what about next week? What do the papers say about my show? Wonderful! Stylish! Extraordinary! Sen-sational! Hey! Hey! Could be descriptions of me-me-me, couldn't they? But no, 'cuz next week it's vid-vid-video-videos! Promos! Bits of film you've never seen before! You just wait, I'll have you sitting on the edge of your sepia leather and pine ''chaise longue''. And if you haven't got any furniture, I'll have you sitting on the edge of your carpet! S-s-s-so: don't miss me next week! And once again... thank you! Thank you! Thank you... Max! (Isn't he great?)"
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The third episode of the Max Headroom talk show featured Simon LeBon and Nick Rhodes promoting their ''Duran Duran'' followup band, ''Arcadia''.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives are fortunate to have recordings of both the Channel Four and Cinemax versions of this episode. The UK version is available, complete, on YouTube.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* Max introduces the show and his guests.
** Video: Intaferon, "Steamhammer Sam"
*** Insert as LeBon says, "Nick, you look just like Richard Gere!"
* Max comments on having his game show idea stolen.
** Video: Bryan Adams, "Heaven"
* Max comments on Simon LeBon's favorite color, and odd shoes and gloves left lying about.
** Video: Jesse Rae, "Over The Sea"
* Max talks about posture and sleeping on futons.
* Commercial break (?)
* Max chides Nick for sitting in a wheelchair (a designer chair with big chrome loops on the sides) and gets them to sit at his bar for "big interview time." (Nick: "God, he's rude, as well!") They chat about:
** Doc Martins
** Max wants to clear one thing up (not their acne - but he isn't going to talk about golf). Who should he aim the questions at? Nick suggests in the middle, towards the fan. Max: "Ah, your one and only fan!"
** Video: Severed Heads, "Goodbye Tonsils"
*** Max likes the name "Arcadia." Simon says it came from a book about the mythical land.
** Max asks Nick about the new album, "So Dead the Nose." Nick corrects him - it's "So Red the Rose" - and says of the cities it was recorded and mixed in, he prefers Paris to New York.
** Video: Arcadia, "Election Day"
*** Max asks "SLB" (or "SOB"?) which city he liked better. Simon says he liked the girls in Paris and the money in New York...
*** Max's next question is to both of them: "St. Andrews, Wentworth, St. Andrews, Augusta, St. Andrews, Glen Hills, St. Andrews, Wentworth... what would it mean to you?" Nick: "Definitely not golf."
*** Max asks Simon about sailing. Simon: "Well, I don't know which way up I am..." and Max turns it into a gay joke.
*** Simon accidentally says, "golf course... oh, sh*t" (poorly bleeped) "...I said sh*t... f*ck," (Again poorly bleeped). Max: "Cut! Print it! I love it!"
** Max loves their records - "I use them for frisbees all the time" - and gives them each a small "snow storm" (snowglobe), which they pick up and shake. (One has a small sailboat, the other might be a skier on a mountain. "Simon, the boat's for you.") He thanks them for the rare and meaningful experience.
* Video: David Bowie, "Loving The Alien"
** Max: "Ah, god, the guy's a genius.
* Max makes  a closing comment about next week's show.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
Although this show is usually listed as the third installment and was shown in that order on Cinemax, it was shown second on Channel Four. Thus the closing monologue by Max was edited slightly differently for each release. The UK version omits the reference to "next week's guest, Roger Daltrey" since he had appeared the previous week; the US version left the tag in place since the shows were run in production order.

The Bryan Adams video has Adams performing to a theater full of TVs showing an audience. Chicken, egg, Max...

Although the ''Arcadia'' album discussed on this show, "So Red the Rose," would be the band's only release, since it was a side project for LeBon, Rhodes and drummer Roger Taylor, it went multi-platinum worldwide.

&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
(''Max's speech in these shows uses extreme stuttering and repetition, which I will not attempt to replicate in the transcriptions here. You can assume that any stutter noted goes on many times longer.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "And coming up soon  here on the Max-Max-Max Headroom show, the two and only Simon LeBon and Nick Rhodes. They-They've brought their mascara with them and they're going to be having one petite discussionette with little old ''moi''. (aside) Get oot the best ''coops'', Martha..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Boy, you can't trust anyone in this business. You know, on a recent show, I suggested a new game show called 'Stake Your Bedroom Furniture.' Well, I'm damned if there isn't a new game show coming out soon on a major network called: 'Stroke the Piece of Furniture.'  Hmm. All the contestant has to do is stroke one of the prizes - like a refrigerator, hi-fi system or videocassette player - in a more loving and sexy way than the hostess, and they get to keep the prize. I'm keeping my mouth shut in the future."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Yes, I'm sure I'm - they'd all love to know Simon LeBon's favorite color, but what about the more important questions in the world, like, who is it that loses that odd shoe you find lying in the gutter? And is it that same idiot who leaves one soaking-wet glove stuck on a spike of the park railings? Ha! Ha! And the funny thing is... it's blue. ...not the glove. Simon's favorite color."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Now I'm going to say a word: po-po-posture. Mmm. Now, there's a nice ''Ti-i-ime'' magazine, working-for-you, in quotation marks, it's a legger ''now'' kind of word, isn't it? Posture. Sort of makes you sit up and listen. M-m-m. Sit up ''properly'' and listen. People sleep in beds with posture springing. Well, most people, except, how shall I put it right off the top of my head... the Japanese. The Japanese don't have beds, they sleep on a ''fu-ton''. Futons are very popular and very expensive, and they consist of nothing more than a stuffed sack. Weird. Well. Very good for your posture, and they help you relax and dream. Mostly about sleeping in a proper bed."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "And next week, only on the Max Headroo-Max Headroom show, exclusive to your TV screen, nowhere else, not in your bathroom, not in your kitchen-kitchen, not in your garden shed, I'll be teaching you how to interview a superstar politely. And with reverence, humility and respect...

: &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;'''UK Version ends:'''&lt;/span&gt; "...ha-ha-ha... (Simon LeBon reaches over and switches off Max's TV. A female announcer adds, "I suspect that's the only way to shut him up," and pitches Max's two books.)

: &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;''' US Version ends:'''&lt;/span&gt; "...ha-ha-ha... but first, I'll be talking to Roger Daltrey." (Simon LeBon reaches over and switches off Max's TV.)

(''Max's speech in these shows uses extreme stuttering and repetition, which I will not attempt to replicate in the transcriptions here. You can assume that any stutter noted goes on many times longer.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Coming up - coming up-yes! yes! (makes O-face) soon on my show, yes, coming up-coming up (sorry, I used to work in an elevator), yes, I'll be squeezing a line or three out of Mr. Roger Daltrey. (aside) Rog? Be with ya in a moment. Take it easy, will ya?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Hi. If you want to feel safer in ''your'' car, the most popular method is to buy a... St. Christopher. ("Winning smile.") Light up. And what most people like to do is hang it in their windscreen. This is a ''good'' idea... because it swings around and distracts you on long journeys. (Sound of car failing to start.) And if you think that's bad, then..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Of all the creatures in the cos-cos-cosmos, how come the moth is so stu-stupid? It hates the light, it only comes out in the dark, and then it spends all night beating itself silly. And where? Against the light bulb. So if any of you dumbo moths are listening, come out in the day... there's light ''everywhere''."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Time Announcer:&lt;/span&gt; "...third stroke, it will be ten-twenty nine, precisely..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Uh, huh... okay, right..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Time Announcer:&lt;/span&gt; "At the third stroke, it will be two-sixteen and twenty seconds."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Yeah, uh-huh, yeah..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I know what it's like to be an exhibitionist, big fella... I'm not one myself, I'm far too humble - modest - that kind of thing... I know the attraction of disporting one's self on stage. Is there still a big urge to get up there and show-show it all off, kind of zip off the Levi's and bingo, Bob's your uncle?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Roger Daltrey:&lt;/span&gt; "Of course there is. It's like a drug - you become addicted to it."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Roger Daltrey:&lt;/span&gt; "Where's the [bottle] opener?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Just crack it on the table. Crack-crack it on the TV, if you like... it's made of uranium. I won't feel a thing."


The closing riff is an edited version of the one used for [[Episode CH4.2.2]]:
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "(sobbing)...and I'd like to take this opportunity of thanking the one and only... (grins) Max Headroom, for giving you all such a wonderful time. So, what about next week? What do the papers say about my show? Wonderful! Stylish! Extraordinary! Sen-sational! Hey! Hey! Could be descriptions of me-me-me, couldn't they? But no, 'cuz next week it's vid-vid-video-videos! [...] S-s-s-so: don't miss me next week! And once again... thank you! Thank you! Thank you... Max! (Isn't he great?)"&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The fifth Max Headroom talk show featured only videos and some Max riffs.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain a complete recording of the Cinemax version of this episode.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* Max opens the show with a groovin', get-down hip-hop riff. (Embarrassing, from a late perspective...)
* Video: The Cult, "She Sells Sanctuary"
* Max claims he's a classical music person (as we all know).
* Video: Peter Gabriel, "Shock The Monkey"
* Max talks about his golf lessons and shows a film about golf balls being made, with some offscreen help.
* Video: Izzy Royal, "Coronation Street"
* Max talks about having Severiano Ballesteros as a guest.
* Video: The Kinks, "Come Dancing"
* Max gives advice on how to dress like a real man.
* Video: Pat Benatar, "Love is a Battlefield"
* Max tries to narrate a Jack Nicklaus golf clip only to be interrupted.
* Video: Ledernacken, ''"Ich will dich essen"'' ("I Want to Eat You")
** Max talks about letters asking about his legs.
* Max announces Boy George will be on his next show.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
This show has an offscreen speaker interacting with Max, a very young-sounding child Max calls Tim. Max also implies that Tim has something to do with the production of the show (in choosing guests, etc.) The voice is uncredited. The only "Tim" who appears to have had anything to do with the show is Tim Johns, occasionally credited for "Additional Dialogue" but not listed in the credits for this episode.

==Quotes &amp; Caps==
No unique visuals in this episode.

&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
(''Max's speech in these shows uses extreme stuttering and repetition, which I will not attempt to replicate in the transcriptions here. You can assume that any stutter noted goes on many times longer.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Oh, oh, you ''down'', yeah, ah right, it's the Max Cornelius Headroom Show, where the pace is hot and the films(?) are not, so watch this and put some pep in yo' step, some cut in yo' strut, roll in yo' stroll, pride in yo' stride, Slick, and some [unintelligible] in your [ditto], yeah! (looks aside) Why [not?] sit here and look what I'm talking about?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "These... (snickers) ''chuckles'' videos are all very well, but I'm a - ha, ha - classical music person. As I think you know..."


''"Tim" is a young child's voice, offstage and not seen.''
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "The golf lessons are going incredibly well - backswing, coming along, approach shots to the green, coming along... putting, still needs some work on it, but, uh, I'd say it's getting there. Nine out of ten.
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Tim:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, I think that people aren't going to say that [?], Max." [?]
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Oh. Now, don't go away, 'cuz I've got something ''really'' great to show you. Now, I know these videos are very good, but... you can have too much of a good thing. And your mind can sort of O.D. on them. So really, they can be dangerous. And so, by way of a change, here's something... you must not miss. It's unique. I don't believe it's ever been seen on TV before, because I brought it in myself today. And it's totally different. It's a rare film of how golf-golf-golf balls are made. Gents... look at this.
: (We get a grainy old film of golf ball manufacture.)
: Oh, look at that... that is incredible! That's amazing! Yeah! God, it gets better all the time. Woo! There, you see? Who says I don't know what the public wants, hmm?
: (looking offscreen) How do you know?
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Tim:&lt;/span&gt; "It's a pop videos program."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "That has nothing to do with it. A lot of people who watch pop videos are interested in golf. Do a survey for once in your life, Tim."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Tim:&lt;/span&gt; "I did, Max."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Now..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Why does he do it... why does he do it to me? He says to me, 'M-M-M-Max, who you want on your show that's really fascinating and really special?' So I say, 'Easy! Severiano Ballesteros. He can come on and talk about golf.' And Tim says, 'Who is he?' ...Who is he? He's only won the US Masters, the Dunhill Masters, the British Open, the French Open ''and'' the Spanish Open... need I go on? ...Oh, it makes me angry. Okay, he says Ballesteros isn't interesting; I'll prove him wrong. I'll tell you about him. Listen to this:
: Severiano Ballesteros is very, very interesting. He is Spanish. He comes from Spain. He wears really stylish sweaters and has very interesting dark hair. And... wait... wait! He plays... wait!... he plays... he play golf! ...Ah, what's the point..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Okay, seems a lot of you... guy-guy-guys have taken my advice on dress, and are now walking around in baggy shorts and flip-flip-flops. Great. If you see me, give me a wave - I love to see the style. (I also enjoy a good laugh.) But now you're writing in and asking me the big one, the advice to beat all advice: how to walk out on the street and look a real man.
: Okay. You want to look macho, right? Here's how you do it. First, it's how you move. Try to get that all-important shoulder twitch. Getting that nice, subtle hint of the hairy back just tickling away, there, under the shirt - ''essential'' for the macho man. But not ''too'' twitchy, or your cigarette packet will fall out of the pocket in your sleeve.
: Now: where to work. I'm afraid macho men do not work in public libraries. (Sorry, all you he-man bookworms.) Though, if you have to, at least stamp the books very hard. And, if possible, carry them around in a brick hod.
: Lesson number two: If possible, get a job on a building site, giving full opportunity to wear the two-shirt t-shirt and the baggy hipster jeans, just about to slide down over the hips. So when you bend down, you expose that essential nine inches of the bottom of your back. And of course, that is the perfect place for your gold chain or your 'I Love Mary' tattoo. See? Think original. And, working out of doors does allow you to address passing women with the macho conversation opener: (wolf whistle), and 'Whhhuuut?' - not to be confused with the standard greeting of male friends 'Ooh-whut oo-whut ol' son?'
: (sound of feet running away) Damn... don't get frightened. I'm only ''telling'' them about it... wait! Wait! ...sheesh... these guys..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "The big G. Golf. ''That's'' what it's all about.
: (video of Jack Nicklaus) Look at that concentration. Such a lovely swing. Oops - that's in the trees, that's in the trees, it's going way left... nope, it's right on course. It's right on course. No, he's lost his ball. No, it looks good! Will it go? ...ohhh, so close. Well, it looks very much like he'll drop a shot here, and now it's just a question of nerves. The greens are holding; he can fire that straight at the flag. Great shot... will it carry? He's kind of looking worried, and I'm not surprised.
: (video countdown leader starts behind Max) Tch! You've done it again, Tim. I'm trying to add a bit of spice here and what happens, you walk all over me. Where's the variety? I'm looking for something different in this show - the emotional equivalent of a mixed bag of nuts! Some laughs, some tears, some fears, but more than that I want some golf clips! Long ones, with close-ups of Nick Feldman's haircut. And bunkers! (I love sand.) No! Wait! Don't cut me off! ...oh, forget it."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Tim:&lt;/span&gt; (unintelligible)

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Listen here, everyone. I'm getting a lot of letters about my legs. True... legs. For example, 'Dear Max: If you haven't got any legs, how on earth do you wash your feet?' Hmm. And another: 'Dear Max: Seeing as how you don't have any legs, could I have your trousers?' Talk about kicking a man when he's down. Yeah - let's talk about kicking a man when he's down. How do you think I feel when I can't even kick a man when he's up?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "And onnnn next week's show stroke episode stroke the inside of my thighs if I had any, I'll be in my own home - yes, in my very own kitchen stroke diner stroke wha-wha-whatever you want to talk about. And I'm going to swap some stories, bandy some banter, and lever a line or two out of who? who? Yes, you guessed it: Ha! Ha! Surprised me, too. Boy George! Yes, me and Boy George! What a combo! Ama-ma-ma-mazing! But it's not important what I think, it's what Boy George thinks that counts, and he thinks I'm amazing, too! ...and he's right! Don't miss it! On your peril!

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The last episode of the second season of the Max Headroom talk show featured ''Culture Club'' lead singer Boy George.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain a complete recording of the Cinemax version of this episode. A clip of of the Boy George interview can be found on YouTube.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* Max introduces the show and his guest Boy George.
* Video: The Police, "Synchronicity II"
* Max sulks about his lack of fan mail.
* Video: Belouis Some, "Imagination"
* Max compares the US to an epic movie.
* Video: Paul Hardcastle, "19"
* Max muses about Beethoven's deafness.
* Video: Black Lace, "Agadoo"
* Max and his guest Boy George talk about:
** What to call each other
** Sanity and insane asylums and recording Culture Club's next album in Switzerland
*** Clip from video: Culture Club, "Victims"
** Max asks George about golf and gets a scorching reply
*** Video: Culture Club, "Victims"
** George's book &amp; Max's book (Max yawns and gets zinged again)
** Acting on "The A-Team" and "Dynasty"
** Max is back to golf...
*** Video: Culture Club, "Victims" concludes
** Minorities &amp; gays
** The Athens concert (George refuses to answer)
*** Video: Bonzo Dog Doo Da Band, "Urban Spaceman"
**** Insert: Max chides George for touching up his makeup with a powderpuff
** George's career ("I'd like to go about ten more years.")
** Max gives George an autograph book with his signature on the first page and insists that he not thank him.
* Max croons "It's Been a Great Show" to close the show and the season - all about his own wonderfulness, of course - in what might be the first appearance of his white suit.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
Max makes passing references to a number of provocative, even touchy subjects with George, who ignores or brushes them off. At this time, George was refusing to talk about his sexuality and did not come out as "militantly gay" for a number of years, so Max's comments about supporting gay causes are more edged than they might seem. (He also threw gay comments at Simon LeBon; it's hard to imagine these near-slurs would have been allowed in later eras.)

The question about the Athens concert is interesting. Although mostly forgotten, the punk/Anglo music concert in late July 1985 was a tense, fraught conflict between performers from a disliked culture performing in the midst of another. The performers were booed and pelted and near-riot conditions persisted. You'll find an &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://punkarchaeology.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/rock-in-athens-85/ excellent writeup here]&lt;/span&gt;.

Max (Matt Frewer) again calls the guest gift a "momento" - as he did with Sting's golf shoes.

&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
(''Max's speech in these shows uses extreme stuttering and repetition, which I will not attempt to replicate in the transcriptions here. You can assume that any stutter noted goes on many times longer.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Here on the Max-Max Headroom show, I'll be having a head to head, shoulder to shoulder, eyeball to eyeball, mascara to mascara-to mascara confrontation with Boy George. Could be messy. I don't know who's more nervous: Boy-Boy-Boy... or George."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Fan mail. Well, I haven't had any yet.

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Who was it that said watching the United States is like watching an epic movie. Oscar Wilde? Woody Allen? ...M-M-Max Headroom. Just think: they've got an actor for a president, economic advisors called projectionists, even their latest defense strategy is named after a film: ''Star Wars''. And why pick on that one? Why not something gentler, like ''Kramer Vs. Kramer''? And of course, everywhere in the world to them is just a theater of operations... except when they're fighting in it. And then, it's a theater... of war."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You know, I was singing that tune just the other day. And I got a kind of... heh, heh... a kind of ringing in my ears and suddenly I couldn't hear a thing. And I thought: if Beethoven was deaf as a post, how did he know what he was playing? For example: if his piano was out of tune when he played 'duh-duh-duh-DUM,' what was the tune he was actually playing in his head? It could have been 'aga-doo-doo, aga-doo-doo' - it's a pity, because he could have had a big hit with that."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Now, this could be tough for you, because I'd like to get right down to that olllld nitty-gritty. The bottom. Line, as they say. And ask you this question: What do you think of golf?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Boy George:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, I've got better things to do with my balls."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (yawns) "Sounds like a heavy, serious, down-to-earth, kinda... ball-ball-ballsy book."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Boy George:&lt;/span&gt; "You should read it. It has a lot of advice for abnormal people, you'd enjoy it."
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The premiere episode of the second Channel Four season of the Max Headroom talk show featured actor Michael Caine, as well as a spacious new set.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain complete recordings of both the US and UK broadcasts of this episode.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==

* Max joins his audience on a long boom crane bearing his monitor.
** He speaks with "Roh-zherre," "Me?" and "L-A-R-R-Y, Larry."
** He hassles a man about his clothes.
* Video: Cherry Bomz, "Hot Girls" begins.
** Max interrupts with a reveries about the sounds of nature... but another time, because this week he's in...
** Italy! Land of music and Ferrari drivers trapped in Fiats.
* &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK version only:&lt;/span&gt; The Cherry Bomz video continues briefly.
** * &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK only:&lt;/span&gt; Max introduces the commercial break as the "Wasting Money Award," a bit recycled in one of the early ABC series breaks.
** * &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK only:&lt;/span&gt; a "Max Headroom" placeholder card composed of Edison Carter's silhouette in the dark, with a neon-green version of the broken barrier overlaid.
* The Cherry Bomz video plays to conclusion. 
* More Italy! Land of unfinished buildings and more music.

*** Video: Talking Heads, "And She Was"
** Caine's first ambitions.
** Golf! Caine's handicap is... that he can't play. It's unnatural.
** Max thinks there should be a great golf movie (like ''The Great Gatsby'').
** Caine thinks no sports movie can be a big moneymaker, not even Max's script for "The Fourth Hole."
*** ...more video...
** Max quotes Caine's father about doing a profession that can't be replaced with a machine - so he became an actor. (But what about... Max?)
** Caine's movie heroes, especially Humphrey Bogart.
** "Ridley" comes on stage to take Caine off and has a weird exchange with him.
*** ...let's finish up that video now.
* Max has some advice for youngsters about... the opposite sex.
* More "Broomstick Men."
* Max giggles his way out over the credits with babbling nonsense about France and Germany.
** Ridley, trying to cut him off, whacks the cameraman in the nuts.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
This show is far more "fully produced" than its predecessors, including a full opening title sequence and theme and multi-camera coverage of the large "talk show" set. There is a full audience in a standard talk-show stadium seating arrangement, configured to let the camera (and Max) visit them.

The added character "Ridley" (apparently a stage manager) is a rather labored attempt to add the sidekick Max has joked about on prior shows. The actor who plays the part, Paul Shearer, has a long career in British television and a few movies, and was a member of the Cambridge Footlights. He was also the winner of the first Perrier Comedy Award in 1981, along with fellow Footlighters Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and Emma Thompson.

The UK version contains the first of what will be unique-to-Channel 4 lead-ins to a commercial break, giving Max full reign to snark and dump on the show sponsors. The shows were shown with a short commercial break in the middle in the UK, which was removed on the "premium" no-commercials Cinemax. This first intro is one of Max's deadliest, calling the commercials entries in a contest to see who can waste the most money on pointless short TV segments. (A briefer version was used in an early ABC series episode and probably helped lead to ABC's dislike for its own show.)

There is no information to be found about the physical comedy trio "The Broomstick Men" that appears in this episode. They appear entirely in a video inset on the "Max TV" but on the main show set within it.

A list and discussion of the montage of caricatures in the title sequence TV/mirror can be found on the [[The Max Headroom Show#Third Season Title Credits | general show page]].

(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Hey, we've got some TV screens! We got an audience! We got a set! We got music, and I've got a great idea, kids! Let's do the show right here! Yay! Hurray!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Sir - you.
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Man in red shirt:&lt;/span&gt; "Yes?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You are a man with real style."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Man:&lt;/span&gt; "Mmmmm... good enough."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Did the lady on your left [also wearing a red shirt] choose your clothes?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Man:&lt;/span&gt; "No."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Have you ever thought of asking her to?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Man:&lt;/span&gt; "Maybe."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Have you ever thought of begging her to?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Man:&lt;/span&gt; "No."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Have you ever seen yourself on television before?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Man:&lt;/span&gt; "No."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Now you know why."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "...another time, maybe, because this week I'm in Italy. Yes, Italy! Land of mu-mu-sic. And how they love tourists here. If you lie enough, they make you Prime Minister. And where can you go to really experience the peace and serenity of Italy? That's right-that's right... Moscow! But no, I'm here in the heart of Italy itself - where else but in Rome, ah, Rome, ''tutti Rome'', the roaming and the romanness and antiques and antiquitiness, images and imagaryness, where every day people call up from miles away complaining about the noise of the traffic. Ha, ha ...ah, who cares what the Germans think, anyway? Yeah. Italy. Who was it that called Italy a nation of superb-perb-perb drivers? No. I don't know, either. I see them more as a nation of... Ferrari drivers, trapped inside Fiats.

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "And now, we come to the 'Wasting Mon-Mon-Money Award.' As you know, every year the society makes its own special award for what's considered to be the most expensive and pointless short piece of television. So... so... let's see the nominations, shall we?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Well... but, Italy. Home of the Renaissance, great painters, great architects and such painstaking builders, who will sometimes take centuries to actually finish a buil-buil-building. (Colosseum in background.) Builders with a sense of humor-humor. (Tower of Pisa in background.) Builders conducting a lifelong struggle against rising damp. (Venice in background.) And let's not forget music, I hear you saying that, of course the Italians love their music. They love to hear the ''tremella'', ''alphetto'' and ''vibrato'' (battery-operated, of course) of the classics, especially from the loudspeakers of their ice-cream van. And finally, who could be as emotional as the Italians, how many times have I seen an Italian suddenly burst into tears at the drop of a, oh... government. And such a tal-tal-talent for business. Every year they sell thousands of gallons of colored water across the world and call it ''frascati''. Hmm! Hmm! And so, we must leave Italy and... Okay! Who pinched me!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Buy Compact Disc! Yes, with the power and sensitivity of CD and with well-trained ears, you can pick up every sound that occurs in the recording studio! Lis-listen carefully to your favorite track and you can pick up the most delicate sound, like the sharp ''twa-twa-twang'' from the stiff bristles of Phil Collins' stubble. Yes, hear it actually growing as he played! Hear the squeak of plastic as Michael Jackson blows his nose. The mur-mur-murmur of Rod Stewart's latest girlfriend having reading lessons in the studio next door. Yes-yes! Compact disc opens up a whole new aural universe, with the soft creak of Lionel Ritchie's leather boxer shorts, the squeal of tortured rubber as Prince suddenly changes sexual orientation, and the pitiful cry for help from the cave rescue team trap-trapped in Madonna's navel. See what you're missing?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Does this ring any bells? 'Dad warned me never to take a job they could invent a machine to do, so I figured no one could invent a machine to take over from actors.'"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Michael Caine:&lt;/span&gt; "Right. That's exactly true. That's exactly true."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Okay, so how does it feel to be sitting there... looking at me?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Michael Caine:&lt;/span&gt; "(laughs) Well, if you'd seen some of the actors I've acted with, um, I figure I've already acted with robots, I tell you."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Really? Hmm?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Michael Caine:&lt;/span&gt; "I know so. Actually... In actual fact, two of the biggest box-office successes in the world starred the green frog and a tin shark.
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Green frog and a tin shark... now, let's see, that first one was 'War and Peace' and..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Michael Caine:&lt;/span&gt; "Yes, the other one was 'Lowering Depths.'(?)"

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
This episode opens with a signature piece of Max bizarreness: Max giving a sad end-of-the-show farewell over the closing credits. The regular title sequence then runs... and we're into the game show, "Quiz!"

The "Ridley" sidekick doesn't seem to have survived to a second show.

Vidal Sassoon turns out to be a witty, acid and unflappable target for Max's riffs. It may be one of the few Max show "debates" that the  judges would have to give to the visiting team. Of course, by this time Max and his approach to interviewing were better known and rather than expect a gentle comedy exchange, Sassoon went in prepared to deflect Max's snark. Only Sting seems to have done almost as good a job overall, and he had little or no warning of what to expect. (At least one of Sassoon's comments about golf reflects Sting's replies as well.) In any case, the interview segment is one of the fiercest of the entire set.

The snark about Sassoon's good looks is clearer if you understand that Sassoon was just short of 60 at the time, and looks at least 20 years younger. (But what would you expect?) He would live until he was 84. His serious comments about dying with his full faculties ("I don't see myself as a cabbage") proved to be true, and he was active and involved with his business and philanthropic efforts until his last days. Frankly, he was a &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidal_Sassoon pretty fascinating guy]&lt;/span&gt;.

(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Well... well... well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid we've come to the end of our show, and we'd just like to thank you for letting us into your homes t-t-to share some laughs with you, and maybe spread a little happiness... your way. Now, the only thing left for me to say is, we'll call around again very soon, and we hope that you're going to be at home when we ring your bell." (calls offstage: "Can I have some te-te-tears, please!" - tears appear on his cheek "Thank you.") (sobs) "G-g-g-goodnight, everyone. God-god-god bless! I love you! I love you!" (turns blase again "Okay, tears back in the box.") (regular opening credits roll.)

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Hi, and a big-big-big welcome to my game, 'Quiz!'" (a chorus sounding like Munchkins sings the Quiz theme song) "Yeah, god, I love it when those short people sing like that! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the spot in the show where we play the game called... Quiz!" (chorus sings theme song again)

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Again and again and again and again and again... isn't nature a wonderful thing?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Y'know, these days there [are] a lot of free-thinking people who are ecology-conscious, and want a clean atmosphere and a world free of litter and waste. And-and-and I understand this, so I'm gonna give you some good advice. Next time you empty your ashtrays, Hoover bags and kitchen waste bins, don't-don't leave it all outside for collection. No,  do what everyone else is doing: take it direct to the municipal garbage pitch. You'll find it on the pavement right outside your nearest hamburger or fried chicken takeaway. That's all."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Where am I... Where am I... (sniffs) Can you smell it? Can you? That unmistakable aroma of ''cafe au lait'', fresh-baked croissants and ''en gar-leek''. Yes-yes, I'm in France. Not-not-so-gay ''Paris'', where only the river is Seine (which happens to be my favorite joke) and how the French adore their distinctive smells. They adore their open air. The ad-ad-adore the distinctive smells of their open-air toilets. The French love rich and delicate ''haute'' cuisine, and they hate fast convenience food, but who can blame them? Fast is the only way to be in their conveniences... yes, a French toilet's a simple hole in the ground that speaks volumes, and [be(?)]sides any shitty toilet in the world is like a breath of fresh air.
: But France of course means wine, and its symbol must surely be... the grape-the grape. Oh? Like the French: the grape. Tough on the outside, bumped(?) on the inside with little bits that want you make to spit. Yep-yep-yep! The French wine." (''accents make remainder unintelligible'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Hi. Now there's one thing in every show that I just wouldn't miss for the world... and that's the commercials-the commercials. They really are brilliant. So don't dash off and pour yourself a drink, stay here with me and watch these! Great! Swell! Neat! Fab! Chri-Chri-Christ! ...thank God-thank God for that. ...uh. Time for a break."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "What else is France? It's famous for its guillotine, its Bastille and other foul-tasting cigarettes. Well, it's a country with a vast cul-culture behind it. A long way behind it. A culture stretching all the way from the can-can to... the can-can. Let's not forget those brave fighters in the wartime French resistance who went un-underground in 1940 and came out again in 1945! God, they must have been dirty! And let's not forget the million achievements of French design - the black beret, the onions on a string (that's weird-that's weird), the greasy breadrolls with unusual shapes and best of all, in the unending quest for a modern battery-driven car, only the French could have leapt ahead by designing a car that looks like a battery! Yes-yes-yes! Well, friends, it's a country world-famous for its surprisingly acrid cigarettes, its surprisingly p-p-pungent cheeses, its surprisingly foul toilets, and everywhere beautiful perfume... which isn't at all surprising."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Now: as you know, stylish, and el-ee-gant are not words that I use lews-lee... unlike 'my modesty,' which I find I use all the time. So, when someone is lucky enough to meet-meet me has enough style and el-ee-gance to fill a whole room, that's when I find other words to say, like 'do you mind leaving the room?' Or, in this case, something like 'who would have thought I'd get VD so soon?' Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Vidal 'I was once a hairdresser' Sassoon!" (The last sentence has Max wearing bizarre hair-scissors glasses.)

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "So you're the actual V-V-Vidal Sassoon... God, you look wonderful!"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, what did you expect, Max... I mean, really? Health foods every morning; vitamins; sixty pills a day..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Quick dry cement in the old crow's feet?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "...jumped into the pool this morning... I mean, I try and do it all."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "When did you cease cutting hair and start building a huge corporation, and was there a specific time?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Cutting hair you earn a damned good living - you meet an awful lot of marvelous people, interesting people, fascinating people, which helps you in your growth. That's exciting."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Hair growth?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Yeah, hair growth, yeah. ...you could use some."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I'll bet you've done some strange cuts in your time. What's the weirdest haircut you've ever given anybody?
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "On you, about a half hour ago."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I've been peeking at the Vidal Sassoon product range, and I've seen shampoos, conditioners, rinses, gels, mousses, deers, antelopes, hitsies(?), sprays, body glazes - I mean, if you put that lot on you'd look like a model AirFix kit. Are people really that unhappy with their 'neutral' [did he mean 'naturelle'?] hair?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, if you look around any city, most people must be very unhappy and very insecure, because they dress... for instance, you must be very secure - look at you. You're the epitome of what most kids would want to look like when they grow up... if they don't get lucky. Very few people have the courage to be an individualist, and I find it very exciting. I'm kind of, almost in trepidation, because when I work with people on television before, you look into their eyes, to get the sense of them, and you're talking to a human being. I sense I'm... in some sort of capsule, talking to a robot. It's kind of exciting."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Are you on drugs, Vidal?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Uh... I will be, after I leave this show, I can assure you."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Would you ever want to, uh, find a range of hair-care products for armpits, though? I don't know, maybe, you know, armpit toupees or something?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Possibly leg pits. I'm not sure about armpits."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Leg pits. Incredible."
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Pubic hair should be heart-shaped this year."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I gather you don't play golf."
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "God, I think that's for old men - it's such a dreary goddamn game... my God. How do you get into that thing? I mean, four hours, walking around..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "[I swear to hell(?)], if I had a howitzer now, I would turn it on you so god damn fast..."
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "...with a bunch of drunks... I mean, what kind of exercise is that?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You said you were into esthetics... you don't think-think that Seve Ballesteros' backswing is esthetic?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Yeah, but it happens once every ten minutes."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "What do you mean it's every ten minutes? What about when he's on the practice range?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Uh, most people are not interested in practices, just in the real thing. I think golf is an absolute bloody bore."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You don't think practicing is the real thing? What about the hours that you slaved away with your garden shears, practicing for the time when you would get a chance to do your god damn Madame Pompadour hair style?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Yes, but I didn't expect anyone to watch me practicing, and I didn't."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; [babbling and distraught] "But you were doing it for you-you, and that's important!"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Vidal Sassoon:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, if you feel that... that-that truly about golf, I have to tell you: I hate it."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Do you suffer from spots, pimples and other adolescent skin problems? Then remember A-G-E, the number one cure for youth. A-G-E works on your body day in, day out, day in, day out... adds hair, then slowly removes it. Gives you... confidence, then takes it away. But let our product speak for itself. We asked lovely young model Karen 'I want to be an actress' Mount to test A-G-E:"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Karen:&lt;/span&gt; (young voice) "I just think it will change my life!"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "That was sixty years ago. Notice any difference now, Karen?"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Karen:&lt;/span&gt; (old voice) "Yes, gracious me, it really works!"
:  &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Yes: Age. Available from Earth."

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The third episode of the second Channel Four season of the Max Headroom talk show featured actor Oliver Reed.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain complete recordings of both the US and UK broadcasts of this episode.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==

** Bolshoi, "Away" continues.
* Max greets the audience with a trip down TV "mammary lane" (of weird black and white clips).
* Video: Sir Mixalot, "Square Dance Rap" (using old Disney-era animation).
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;In the UK version only&lt;/span&gt;, Max interrupts with the exciting moment of the weekly Choose-Your-Favorite-Adverts contest, and the winners are those chosen by Her Highness the Queen Mother.
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK only:&lt;/span&gt; Max Headroom Show placeholder card, and commercial break.
** And this week, we're in... China! Rather offensively...
* Sir Mixalot, "Square Dance Rap" continues.
** Guest Oliver Reed interrupts the ending.
* Max and his guest Oliver Reed talk about:
** His tough guy image (but he's really a pussycat).
** His films: "The Devils" (1971) and "Women in Love" (1969) and censorship.
** Getting naked in films as a better option to violence and gore, especially for children.
**Nudity in films as a risk for major actors in earlier eras, and how the controversial male wrestling scene in "Women in Love" was filmed.
*** Video: Luis Cardenas, "Runaway" (using dinosaur puppets).
** Max asks Reed about being a sportsman... and Reed is snoring, eyes open.
*** Luis Cardenas, "Runaway" continues.
** Max tries to provoke Reed over drinking, and adds that he knows he has a short temper. ("No, Max... I'm a very cool dude. A mean ''whoop-whoop'', but I'm a cool dude.")
** Max asks if Reed, as a country boy, likes any blood sports. ("No.")
** Max asks Reed about his new film, "Castaway" - and Reed responds at great length in his slow manner, which the show producers handle by speeding up most of Reed's reply to Daffy Duck levels.
** Max calls the segment "an honorable draw" with Reed.
*** Luis Cardenas, "Runaway" concludes. (The title card that passes has his name misspelled "Cardinas.")
* And it's time once again for... "Quiz!"
** Cue munchkin chorus of the theme song...
** Tonight's prize is a trip for two to Las Vegas to see the Boomtown Rats in concert, and meet them.
** The question is... "Who is the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats?"  &lt;span style="color:#606060;"&gt;(Bob Geldof...)&lt;/span&gt;
*** There is no answer from the audience, so the prize is saved for another night.
* And it's "Goodnight!"
** Max does a riff on colognes for men over the closing credits.
* Max (in the white suit) and Max (in the black suit) sing a crooner duet of "We're Just Good Pals" on two facing TVs, amid chummy banter.
* Max gives a short closing riff that appears to be partly in German or Dutch purely to allow him to bark out the word "cunt!" - which sends him into hysterics.
* Max says they're coming up on the moment he's been waiting for for... minutes. (screen goes black)

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
Shockingly, there is no mention of golf in this episode, not even in the interview.

Oliver Reed is perhaps not well-remembered today, especially to U.S. audiences, but he was one of the most popular actors in the UK during the peak of his career in the 1960s-1990s. He was known for his portrayals of very tough, brutal characters, which may not have been too far from his real persona. In any case, he was even more widely known as a three-fisted drinker whose alcoholism and prodigious intake led to many stories, many of them involving violence or implied violence from Reed.

It is not clear who Max might be referring to as "the little bird" who told him about Reed having a short temper, especially over his drinking, but it probably refers to some recent incident of the time. In 1975 Shelly Winters dumped a glass over Reed's head on ''The Tonight Show'' because of his drunken comments about women. About a year after this appearance on Max's show, David Letterman had to backpedal at high speed when it seemed that he had enraged Reed to the point of physical violence with questions about his drinking. (If anyone knows of a specific incident ca. early 1986 in which Reed may have put "a little birdie in a sling" - please let me know.) YouTube is full of "drunken Oliver Reed being obnoxious and threatening" clips, for those interested.

All of which makes Reed's very gentle, soft-spoken repetitions of "No, Max" take on a Hannibal Lecter-like vibe...

The closing duet is long (about 3:30) and may be the first instance of Max singing a full tune. I can find no record of the song and it is hard to tell if it's an obscure standard or show tune (with some muddled lyrics) or something original composed for the show.

(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Hi, there, yes, from around the world, across the nation and up your street- it's your fave-rave relayed VJ jive talking live, walking you through this week's world charts! That's right, it's time to strobe the globe, scan the lands, delve on the shelves  and slit the hits that are twistin' the listeners right across the world tonight. So let's start with a rundown of the top-top thirty, and right in there at number thirty is South Africa, with a double-sider with those two great crowd songs, 'Hit Me with Your Policeman's Stick' and 'Get Me to the Hospital On Time.' And straight in at number twenty-nine, another double-whammer and a first-time entry from Russia, 'We Oughta Frost Old-Style' once again with 'We're Young, Hip &amp; Crazy- Isn't It Fab!' And still at number twenty-eight, it's Poland with 'Gdansk Gdansk' - so good they named it oh good they named it twice. And straight into number fifteen, it's Iceland following their recent eleven-inch that was a mammoth hit in Iceland: 'Fish Soup, Glorious Fish Soup!' And what a day for fish soup, they're now out there again with 'You Say Herring, I Think Cod, Let's Call the Whole Thing Bouillabaisse'! (Those Icelanders ride the mules.) Still riding high at fourteen is Yakloslovakia with that Chuck Berry sound, 'Cruisin' Along In My Trac-Tractor'! And at number thirteen it's the contest big sell from Japan, 'I've Got a Brand New Pair of Horn-Rim Specs'! And-and-and, the big one storming up five places to number one on top of the world this week, the South African version of a Paul McCartney song, a beautiful anthem, to beautiful South Africa, 'Ivory and Ivory'!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (sirens in background throughout) "It was six o'clock. I hadn't had a drink since seven. Either I was drying out or my watch had stopped. My hands started shaking but my watch still wouldn't start. I know what I need: a shot - a shot. A shot in the ear. Acupuncture. At three a.m. I arrived at the surgery. I use the term loosely - was actually more like... three-thirty. A tiny oriental scrap of humanity motioned me to sit on a bit of squalid rush matting. When I sat on his leg by mistake, I knew I was in trouble. He asked if anything was disturbing me. I said noth-noth-nothing. When he rammed a needle in my ear, I said I was disturbed. After two needles, I lost the use of both legs. After four, I lost the use of my car, swimming pool and tennis courts. Aft-aft-after six, [on Intersat(?)] the yellow devil picked up Chinese satellite TV on his DEF-8. It was time to go. I hated Chinese TV, and my book-books were due back at the library. But that's another story. And another accent."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (Most of this is in a truly offensive faux-Chinese accent... ah, the 80s.) "Unmistakable, isn't it? Who could fail to recognize the sweet and gentle &lt;i&gt;gaboing-gaboing&lt;/i&gt; of Chinese music. Yesh. I am in China, one of most remarkable country in world. A nation rich in ancient monument, tweasure, and bicycle love worship. And how Chinese ruv dere bikes! Wing-a-ding on dere bicycle bells and Dinga Winga Winga Ring on their birth certificate! And they don't just use them for work-work, no! On weekends you'll see them skillfully racing their bikes across wet paddy fields, falling off, laughing and saying 'bruddy irriot!' like only the Chinese can. And that's because the Chinese love a challenge. And isn't that why they all wore dull-dull-dull uniforms, because that dribbly soy sauce was always running down their chin and ruining their best clothes? That's a clever race!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Oliver Reed:&lt;/span&gt; "Alan and I got very frightened about taking our clothes off [for a scene in 'Women in Love'], but that was cured by a bottle of vodka each. And the room was very cold, and the firelight was made with what is called a 'dingleberry' with the assistance of a lot of people from the film crew."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "A dingleberry?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Oliver Reed:&lt;/span&gt; "A dingleberry. Which is a..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Sounds like a buffalo chip-chip-chip?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Oliver Reed:&lt;/span&gt; "No, it sounds like something that you have in your head. I know the buffalo chip - what chips do you use in your head?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Ah, nothing, just your standard computer chips. I like 'em with everything."

*&lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, let's get back to rugby a bit. You now, with the lads and the ba-ba-bath and fifteen pints and the quick chorus of 'If I Were the Marrying Kind' and 'The Hairs On My Dickie-Do'... is it the game, or being with the lads, like Alan Bates, that you like so much?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Oliver Reed:&lt;/span&gt; "No, no, Alan Bates has one like a pigeon's egg."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "He has one like a pigeon's egg?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Oliver Reed:&lt;/span&gt; "Yeah."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "On what?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Oliver Reed:&lt;/span&gt; "One hell of an ego."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "And this ones for the... &lt;i&gt;guys.&lt;/i&gt; "Okay? Listen: don't try to tell lies with your aftershave. If your f-f-f-fragrance is 'BullHorn' or 'Rhino Stab' or 'Whiff of Mating' or-or-or 'Rutting Season,' and you're trying to say 'Hey, baby, this is a real man!'... I'm not surprised you're getting nowhere. You see, those aren't fragrances, they are oh-dors. They are riot control weapons. They are the stuff they fire at charging rhinos... and it doesn't work on them, either. And women are not that easily fooled. They know it's just a cover-up... they know it's just a cover-up. They know that if you wear 'Rutting Weapon' that says you'd rather be home stir-frying alfalfa. Or feeding the fish or reading 'The Inner Self.' They know if you were really the knuckle-dragging primate type, you wouldn't admit it. You'd be trying to look sensitive, wearing 'Rodin' or 'Caravaggio' or (?). So listen, stud-stud-throb, women know that when you're at a party smelling like a grizzly's goat bandage that you are not the all-male hairy-chested bristle-chinned stud they're looking for. And how do they know? Because he's over there, smelling like a daffodil. Or you could do what I do, and just wear 'Boink-Boink-Boink-Boink'!

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The third episode of the second Channel Four season of the Max Headroom talk show featured singer, actress and comedienne Tracey Ullman.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain complete recordings of both the US and UK broadcasts of this episode.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* Max appears among a blur of technical and video faults. &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;(In the UK version, a distorted and shattered "4" logo appears; in the US version, those are replaced by the "Cinemax Presents" slide, which briefly appears upside down.)&lt;/span&gt;
* Max apologizes - it's the pressure of being a star, and the guys around him are idle.
* Max plays a concerto on a grand piano, but battles with the rest of the orchestra coming in too soon.
* Max does a cockney huckster riff to the "ladies," throwing in one thing (a video) after another (an interview) for free, even though it's costing him.
* Video: The Smiths, "Panic"
* Max riffs about his early days as an actor in an old Englishman's accent.
* Brief black and white clip of a comedian singing "Figaro."
* And this week we're in... America! Land of delis and cowpokes!
** Brief black and white clip of women wearing bizarre glasses, including a shot of Max in the scissor glasses from the Vidal Sassoon episode.
* Back to America... land of bulletproof politicians and opportunistic muggers.
&lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;''There are significant differences between the UK and US versions at this point.''&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;US: Extended clip of mime Les Bubb doing... comedy dancing. (2:24)&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Much shorter clip of Les Bubb. (0:45)&lt;/span&gt;
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Max responds to the overwhelming viewer preference for commercials in the middle of the show. (0:16)&lt;/span&gt;
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Commercial break: (2:39 total)&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Chappel of Bond Street (musical instruments)&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Timotei hair conditioner&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: National &amp; Provincial Building Society (mortgages)&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Batchelor's Cup of Soup&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: "Dishwash Electric" - generic ad for dishwashers as convenience&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Sensodyne toothpaste&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Max Headroom Show placeholder card.&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK: Continuation of Les Bubb clip (shorter than US version). (1:25)&lt;/span&gt;
* Max Headroom title card and announcement that they have temporarily lost the show.
** Meanwhile, rather depressing WWI-era B&amp;W film clips are shown, with happy musical score.
* And it's 'Quiz!' time again!
** Max knows, because the munchkins are singing the theme song. ("Bury those dwarves!")
** The question tonight: "How many of you have imagined yourself talking to... a star?"
** Max picks Seamus (Max: "Sorry...") from the audience and guides him through an introduction to a special guest meant to make him a "star charmer."
** Seamus introduces Tracey Ullman, who comes on and kisses him.
* Video: Tracey Ullman, "Breakaway"
* Max and his guest Tracey Ullman talk about:
** Not being a Cockney - she's from Surrey, like Fergie, and started off more posh.
** Her daughter's name, Mabel Ellen McKeown.
** What is she doing? Resting, working... or playing golf?
*** Video: Peter Gabriel, "Sledgehammer" intro.
** Max slides in - "Sorry, there was a dachshund nibbling on my ankle, there." (Dak-sund?)
** Plans for her first show in America, and how she wants it to be different, and producers want everything to be formulaic. (Shades of the problems with the ABC series!)
*** Tracey doesn't want to work with cute children on the show.
*** Peter Gabriel, "Sledgehammer" continues.
** Does being married to a millionaire take the edge off her motivation to work? ("No.")
** Tracey's start on a UK comedy show that sank "without a Trace" when she left.
** Her film career with Meryl Streep in "Plenty."
** Her brief music career - "It was a laugh."
*** Max's appearance in "Paranoimia."
** Max's coke ads in America and how he should be raking it in.
** Luck and careers. "Yes, I've been lucky."
*** Peter Gabriel, "Sledgehammer" concludes.
* Max riffs on how wonderful parties are.
* Over the closing credits, Max laughs hysterically and yells "Stop it!" at something below the line of the TV frame.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
This is one of the few places where the show recordings in the MaxRchives let us compare the US and UK versions in detail. There are significant differences in this show, moreso than in the three previous entries this season. Other than the change from the Channel 4 logo to the Cinemax title card in the opening sequence here, the differences between the two runs appear to be omitting any reference to a commercial break in the middle of the show - which was done in the UK, but not on "premium, no-ads" Cinemax. As the shows were aired first in the US, it's hard to say whether both versions were shot and edited simultaneously or the UK versions are later edits.

Max refers to Tracey Ullman several times as "Trace," which may be simple jocularity/familiarity. However, her birth name was... Trace.

The discussion of Ullman's US series would come to fruition about seven months later in "The Tracey Ullman Show," which ran from 1987 to 2000, a total of four seasons of variety perfomances by Tracey as singer, dancer and comedian. There are many comparisons between this show and Max's early days: it premiered in the first week of April on a new network (Fox) struggling to create fresh material, and each network gave its unorthodox performer a lot of control and freedom. (Ullman's show is perhaps most famous and best remembered as the genesis of the long-running animated show "The Simpsons," which started as brief advertising "bumper" skits on her show.)

All in all, a fairly quiet episode of this season.

&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Ha... I'm sorry. It's the pressure of being a star. You know how it is. Oh... you don't. But I do. From time to time I get a little bit... temperamental with the guys around me. You see, I'm the idol of millions, and, well, that's the trouble. They're idle... and I earn millions."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Well, where am I... (whistles first notes of 'The Star Spangled Banner') Yep, you guessed it. Give me an A for Anglo-Saxons, an M for Mexicans, E for Europeans, R for Russians, I for Italians, give me a C for Costa Ricans, an A for Africans, and what have you got... besides a lot of letters? &lt;i&gt;America, America...&lt;/i&gt; Yes, what a mixed bag of a country this is - home of the Chevrolet, home of the home run and don't forget, home of the brave. Eh... was til they wiped 'em all out. Yes, America, where the Indians have never been forgiven for getting there first. And why? Because the Indians didn't introduce anything decent to eat, that's why! The Poles gave 'em pickled gherkins, the Italians brought over pizza, the Germans, sauerkraut... put 'em all together, and whaddya got? Jewish delicatessen. And because Americans don't have to move out of their own country to find every style of terrain, weather and loud checked trousers. Yes-s-s! And it's a troubled country, which has come through the McCarthy trial and tribulation because it ha-has its foundations firmly based on the principles of liberty, fraternity and Laurel and Hardy. Course. Course. And, of course, freedom of speech... something they should never have told Dr. Ruth Westheimer about. But-but-but let's take a good look at what has emerged from a land where having chaps on your legs was something you can talk about openly. From the land of the chuck wagon and... cowpoke. Who got his name from... poking cows. (Let's hope it was with a stick.) Well, c'mon, it's a lonely job driving cattle, right?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Yes. Yes. America is a health-conscious nation too. They live in fear of contagious diseases like herpes, AIDS, being a one-car family. And it's a place where winning means success and losing means a walk-on part in &lt;i&gt;Dynasty&lt;/i&gt;. But they don't just think about money; sometimes they think about how best to throw it away, like having a President driven around in an expensive bullet-proof limousine when he already has a perfectly good bullet-proof head. But I won't be unfair, because it's a well-known fact American politicians are the best money can buy. And, let's just take one final look at what makes America great. Well... of course it's the land of opportunity, where the streets are paved with gold... and whatever else muggers drop as they run away."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "And, you'll remember that on the last show, we asked you to write in and tell us whether you really wanted to see commercials in the middle of the show. And your response was overwhelming! But, I'm afraid it's about the money-money-money-money... &lt;i&gt;arf&lt;/i&gt;"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (Cockney accent) "Aw ri', dahling, easy question from one artiste to another, Trace, my little rhubarb tart: What are you doing at the moment - resting, working or do-do-doing what most comedians do and playing gol-golf?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Tracey Ullman:&lt;/span&gt; "My husband plays a lot of golf, Max... and it really gets on my tits."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Okay, you have some hush-hush plans for a series in the States. Now, do you want to share it with your dirty Uncle Max? Tell all, tell all, tell me dahlin'!"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Tracey Ullman:&lt;/span&gt; "[...] I couldn't tell you - I'm not going to give you the scoop on your show. [...] But you go in with good intentions for an American TV show - you want to make it different and you know, a bit cruel and everything, and they always want to make it the (changes to American accent) 'care and share show.' 'Tracey, there is a problem with the beginning of the show, and everyone's happy at the end, with caring and sharing.' They say, 'How about a cute little kid with a little cap, you know, that helps Tracey out and says "Let's eat pizza!" and they always want to get some cute little kid in with you, and I don't like cute little kids, you know. Some little kids."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Quite often they're muggers. Short muggers, and your knees take a real beating."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Oh, yeah, Saturday night.... Saturday night! Yeah, that's right, it's party time, and we're all off to... &lt;i&gt;eyuh&lt;/i&gt;, Simon and Amanda's. Oh, yeah, aren't parties great? Where else can you stroll uninvited into the home of two complete strangers, sneer at their decor, sneer at their music, stub out a cigarette on their carpet, and then stagger into the kitchen for a plate of Hungarian liebfraumilch with lumps of cork floating in it? Hmm? Where else can you &lt;i&gt;guys&lt;/i&gt; practice your eye to eye contact and try out that line you rehearsed in front of the mirror: 'Say, lady, what say we wrinkle some underlay tonight?' (That's always worked for m-m-m-me.) Where else can you spend the evening groping well-dressed girls bopping all over the floor and broken glass and other peoples' feet, then head back into the kitchen for a large bowl of rice salad with one shrimp in it, and another fifteen glasses of semi-sparkling bat-batter-battery acid while enjoying an urgent discussion on the art of the quarterback, quickly followed by an even more urgent discussion with the heart of the toilet bowl? Yes, yes... yes. Parties. Where else can you make a complete asshole of yourself?"

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The fifth episode of the second Channel Four season of the Max Headroom talk show featured actor Rutger Hauer.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contains a complete recording of the UK broadcast of this episode. Hauer's web page contains a dozen photos of the show. Charles McGrew's page contains a number of audio clips that precede the Hauer interview.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* Max appears from the hairline up and has a long argument with the stage crew - "Yeah, well it's been the right height for every other show!"
** The crew puts a box under his chair, with some difficulties in positioning. It's still not tall enough; we see Max from the nose up. He tries to start, then complains again.
** They put another box under the chair. He's almost tall enough... and then falls off the stack. ("Holy shit...!")
** The show titles begin but are inverted and black-and-white with murky audio.
** We cut to Max spinning on a vectorscope display. There's a rewind scrape, then Max appears normally. He mutters threats at the crew ("...put them all up against the wall and shoot them... that'd teach 'em a lesson").
** The normal show opening rolls.
* Max gives a giggly introduction to the show but notes that they have so many things, they might have to cut things like this (shows a credit slide) or this (shows a clip of Tina Turner's video) or even this (shows a clip of the Rutger Hauer interview).
* Video: The Housemartins, "Happy Hour"
** Max interrupts: "Let me play you something really, ''really'' damned good: my favorite album."
*** Plays a birdsong clip, with rock-fan commentary.
*** Record scratch ends the bird sounds; Max rages. "Whaddya mean they won't get it? It's a ''bootleg!''"
* Mac McDonald comedy clip, sticking bread all over his head to protect when "the bomb" goes off.
* Max bops to a heavy techno beat, with dogs barking. "Get down... get down... GET DOWN!" as the dogs drag him away.
* This week, we're in... Scandinavia! Land of flickering Volvo headlights and scenery ranging from forests to... forests.
* Video: Tina Turner, "Typical Male"
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK version only: Max interrupts to show us "The Truth Tester" (another snarky commercial-break lead-in).&lt;/span&gt;
*** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK only: Commercial break with "THE MAX HEADROOM SHOW" placeholder card.&lt;/span&gt;
* We're back in Scandinavia! Land of language and drinking problems, and... sex.
**Tina Turner, "Typical Male" continues.
* Max and his guest Rutger Hauer talk about:
** Max introduces his guest as "Rootbeer Hauer," then addresses him as "Rut."
** His part in "Blade Runner" is Hauer's favorite - it was kind of like Max - in that both have artificial souls.
*** Video: Martini Ranch, "How Can the Labouring Man Find Time for Self-Culture?" begins (black and white clip from "Metropolis").
** Hauer has a lot of energy, and was restless and wanted to find out things for himself.
** Being a man of action - he's physical and likes to trade lines for physical action.
** Golf: Hauer doesn't play, but he's walked on a few courses. There's one behind his house but he's not yet good enough to play on it. The walks are nice, though.
** Hauer admits being color-blind.
** Hauer doesn't get angry - unless someone hits a dog in the street. Animals can't hit back.
** Why was "Blade Runner" so good? (The design was so good and so real, and the music.)
*** But no, it was nothing like "The Max Headroom Show."
** Max thanks 'Rootbeer' for being a great guest... and his biggest.
*** Martini Ranch: "How Can the Labouring Man Find Time for Self-Culture?" continues.
* Max tells children at home alone... "Don't do that!"
* And it's Max &amp; Max &amp; Max this time... one lead, two harmony!
** They sing a vaguely country-rock song about Mary Lou, a dog and a motorbike leading to tragedy. The backup singers keep stopping to comment on the storyline of the lyrics. It fades out to their sobs.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
Mac McDonald appears as a comedian in this show. Fans of the film "The Fifth Element" will recognize him as the older cop who ends up with a full lap of McDonald's soda ("Whoa!")

We don't have the US version of this show on tap, so we don't know what might have filled the "truth tester" sequence on Cinemax. Probably the full length of the Tina Turner video.

The credit slides are scattered through the show at 4 or 5 minute intervals.

Although Rutger Hauer is only 6'1", he dwarfs the chair that seems to have fit other interviewees so comfortably. ("It's like a little nest.") Max later calls him the biggest star he's interviewed - in name and size, it would seem.

Has there always been a Sputnik in the background of the set?

(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Air... c-clean as a surgeon's knife. A place where the sharp scent of pine cuts through the thickest of colds... mmm. Yup-yup-yup: I'm in Scandinavia. The continent with that unmistakable smell of the perfume tablet under a toilet seat. Yup, Scandinavia, with its night sky lit by that strange incessant flickering phen-n-nom-nomenon of the northern hemisphere, known as... the Volvo headlamp. These are strange lands, wreathed in myth and legend. They say that on a still night, when the moon is full, a lucky traveler may see Björn Borg's eyes pass above his nose on their nocturnal migration to the opposite side of his face. A land of ever-changing scenery, from the lakes and forests of Norway to the lakes and forests... of Sweden. And it has a silence broken only by the far-off wailing of an inconsolable Abba fan. And the occasional soft distant ''*pump*'' of an exploding Russian power station."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I'm now about to demonstrate a most interesting device: the Tru-tru-truth Tester. Each of the following films should last ten minutes... unless, that is, the Truth Tester detects any dishonest statement, in which case, it will simply cut the film off and move on to the next one. So... check your watches and let's see if any of these films can run for the full ten minutes of truth. Here goes..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "(Brief comments in Swedish or Norwegian) Yes, Scandinavia is a place with a language problem only surpassed by its drink problem. And why? Because without drink, they cannot understand each other. And drink is a problem the Finns are fighting, by banning cars and insisting everyone travels cross-country on skis. This makes reading the paper on the way to work a bit tricky, but guarantees at least twenty-six gold medals at the Winter Olympics. ...Sex. You know, in the end, you can't deny that the Scandinavians have given the world... sex! Which isn't surprising. With a night that lasts six months, there's a limit to the amount of hot chocolate they can drink. But, Scandinavia really was the first place to open its door to sex and invite it in as a welcome guest. They made it feel at home, they let it put its feet up... its knees up... its legs up. Sex in Scandinavia is like jogging in the rest of the world: it's good for you, it makes you feel better, and if you see someone else doing it, you feel if you had the time, you'd join them, too. If you're like me, all you need is a can of yogurt, a willing partner and a few birch twigs. ''Yiyyy! Thank you, Agnisa!''"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "...'Nighthawks' ...'Flesh and Blood' ...'Ladyhawke' ...'Blade Runner.' What do they all have in common? Yes, a man, after my own sense of drama, Mr. Root-root-rootbeer Hauer. Hey, Rut, welcome to my show. You feeling comfortable?
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "Yes, very."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Are you sure you wouldnt' like a bigger-bigger chair?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "It's like a little nest."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You have played some pretty extreme parts, big fella, haven't you? Which was your favorite?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "Blade Runner."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Blade Runner?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "It was kind of like... your character."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "In what sense of the word? ''My character?'' You mean my personality?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "Yeah, your soul."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I haven't got feet. How can I have a sole?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "That's the problem."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "In what sense of the word?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "It's, um, it's artificial."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You mean your character was artificial?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "No, the soul was artificial.
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I had no idea we'd be getting on to this existential stuff so soon."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "Yeah, well, we can wait. We can wait." 

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "So... R-R-Rut: Golf. You love it, right?
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "Yeah. I don't play... I don't play, yet."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You have a set of golf clubs?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "Uh, yeah, half a set, yeah."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Half a set?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Rutger Hauer:&lt;/span&gt; "Yeah."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "You don't strike me as short enough to have half a set."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I know a lot of children are watching my show along with their parents, but I know there's some kids who are sitting there w-w-watching on their own. And maybe mom and dad have gone out, or they're in another room, so, here's a word for you: &lt;i&gt;Don't do that!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The sixth episode of the second Channel Four season of the Max Headroom talk show featured a figure who was probably most like Max's real-life counterpart, ''Talking Heads'' singer David Byrne.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain a complete recording of the UK broadcast of this episode. The complete interview segment is available on YouTube. Charles McGrew's page contains a number of audio clips that precede the Byrne interview.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* We open on a brief clip of an ad for "Lyril" soap, with its irritating theme. There will be more. 
* Max appears in fast rewind for a few moments, then bounces giddily around the screen while talking about what a wild time he and the crew have, such as staying up talking until quarter to eleven while eating toast. It's just non-stop!
* Video: Curiosity Killed the Cat, "Misfit"
* Max on why Pope John Paul II is the happiest man in the world.
** Lyril ad pops in again.
** Max finishes his last comment about the pope.
* Max talks about what a wonderful show is in store.
** We're interrupted by a news flash: an important message from the Albanian news agency is played in full. (It's all in Albanian, except for 'SS-24 missiles,' 'Reagan,' 'radioactivitat,' and 'Lincolnshire'... and then 'giant gorilla' near the end.)
* Max, in his green plaid suit, tells the audience this is the last show in the current series, and thanks them for all their cards and letters as the end credits roll. "Thank you... Thank you... I love you... Damn you... God bless... I love you... Bye..." The credits end. "What do you mean it's not the last show? How many more? Aw, Je-Jesus Chri..." (the sequence rewinds to the beginning and the regular opening credits roll).
** The credits are interrupted by a second news flash that corrects the first's sentence containing "giant gorilla."
** The credits resume, only to slow to half speed, then pause on the [[media:Mhcom_s3e01_break_card.jpg |"neon green bar" placeholder slide]] from the first UK show of this season.
*** The placeholder card is itself interrupted by a very brief clip of a young woman on a horse.
** The opening credits conclude more or less normally.
* We open on the studio audience to the irritating jingle that tells us...
* Once again, it's time to play 'Quiz!'... and the jingle plays again. (Max: "Squash 'em.")
** This week's prize for one person from the audience: an all-expenses-paid trip to a mystery capital city in the heart of Asia.
** The winner is the first person in the audience who can honestly put their hand up and say they will never be unfaithful to their partner.
*** Most of the audience raises their hand. Max picks 'Simon Simon' and he swears he will never be unfaithful to his (rather pretty) partner.
*** The prize is a week in... Bangkok, the sex capital of Asia. Max runs down the plentiful sex services available...
*** ...and then says it's a waste of time to give it to such a puritan guy, so they'll save it for another time. (Simon: "Nooooo!")
* Video: Gene Loves Jezebel, "Heartache"
* Max has some heart-to-heart advice for sufferers of bad zits.
* Full length Lyril ad this time... the jingle just gets more irritating.
* Max narrates a long clip of ants, spiders and bugs. What's not gross is smutty.
* Brief arty shot of drum set with powerful drum solo.
* Clip of "The Brown Paper Bag Brothers" comedy skit.
* Back to the arty drums... and it's Max playing them. ("Eat your heart out, Ringo!")
* Max and his guest David Byrne (on Max's 'guest TV'!) talk about: 
** Max introduces David Byrne as the avatar of the leading edge.
** Byrne's favorite of his many activities: the fun of cleaning out his refrigerator
** How his stage persona is sillier than himself in real life
*** Video: Talking Heads, "Wild Wild Life" intro
** "As one talking head to another": do fans keep expecting something different all the time?
** The style of his clothes (dark green and purple plaid suit jacket) vs. Max's.
*** Max switches into his own green and purple plaid suit.
** Byrne's film "True Stories"
** Max gets stuck in a cramp laughing and calls for help.
*** He and Byrne switch monitors, which seems to fix things.
*** Video: Talking Heads, "Wild Wild Life" continues.
** Still on opposite monitors, Max asks David if one movie is enough for a guy like him.
*** Byrne would like to make more, in the name of megalomania.
*** It's different from making videos.
** Byrne hopes "True Stories" tells the story of ordinary people well.
** Whether Max's show would work in Belgium.
** Max thanks "the most famous talking head besides... me!"
*** Video: Talking Heads, "Wild Wild Life" concludes.
* It's Puzzle Time! (Max likes Puzzle Time!) And the puzzle this week is about... Max's favorite tattoos.
* Black and white clip of futuristic beauty products to a dramatic score.
* As the Chrysalis copyright stripe starts across the screen, Max in his white suite apologizes to "Nobby" for not being quite ready. He pauses. The stripe rolls back. "Okay, I'm ready." The stripe rolls out all the way across.
* Max in his green and plaid suit and green sunglasses sings a short silly faux-Irish song about his show.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
David Byrne is very different from his performing persona - quiet, shy and humorless and seemingly thrown by Max's sallies at several points. Appearing on a remote link also appears to be more than just a stunt. He has admitted in writings that he may be borderline Asperger's, and his comments about being two different people in person and on stage may reflect his personality quirks.

The repeated jingle for "Lyril" soap may be the most irritating element of any Max show, and that's saying something...

No golf. No country theme. Wait, what show ''is'' this? There is also no overt commercial break, even though this is the UK version.

(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "The happiest man in the world. You? Me-me-me? A Turkish sewer worker with a day off? An Australian who's got a dic-dic-dic... a dictionary? Nope. The pope. (Mm-hmm.) Good old John Paul, the Polish pope, the most popular Italian in the world. But why so happy? Is it his style of living? Well... well... well... with the problems of the poverty-stricken Catholic world on your shoulders, the Vatican must be a very nice place to live. And with those robes, he doesn't have to worry about keeping up with shoe fashions. Is it his talent? Yes, he is the only man who can say'' 'Jesus Christ' ''in fifty languages and make them all sound like he's swearing. Or is it his uniqueness? Being the only one wearing a skirt in Rome who hasn't had his butt squeezed. Yes, happy man. Congratulations, Your Holiness - I smell Guinness!"
: (after a break for the Lyril ad) "...Book of Records!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Can I talk to you about an everyday problem? Do you have really bad skin? Are pimples and acne making you stay indoors? Do your friends talk behind your back... because it's safer? Do they call you 'cactus kisser'? Does your face look like the venue for a mosquito's barn dance? And are you such a regular that you're on first-name terms with the man in your local drugstore? And is he on first-name terms with your zits? Heh. Seriously. Does your geography teacher organize field trips on your back? And do you find you're always picked to swim last in the school relay team? Well, if boil-boil-boils and pimples are making your life a complete misery, if you dread the embarrassment of meeting people... stay at home. You think everybody else want to look at 'em?"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Listen... listen... when it comes to being up-front, state-of-the-art and downright avant-garde, I can pick guests for my show. And if he isn't someone who says 'Now,' 'moder-moderne,' 'leading-edge' and 'you won't catch me cleaning out the refrigerator' then I'll eat my copy of 'Video Monthly.' Ladies and gentlemen, here, in person, on my guest monitor, David 'my friends call me can-you-feel-the-' Byrne! Hi, Dave!"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;David Byrne:&lt;/span&gt; "Hello, Max. Nice to be here."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Now, then. David Byrne. Imaginative. Inno-vut-a-vutive. A respected force, too. And a milestone in visual arts, and a true raining-socks man. (But enough about me.) Which of all your fields of activity are you happiest working in?"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;David Byrne:&lt;/span&gt; "Cleaning out the refrigerator."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "It's Puzzle Time! Puzzle Time! (heh-heh-he-heh) I like Puzzle Time. Which-which is the odd one out? A ship. A swallow. An anchor. A phoenix. Or a girl wearing a skimpy pair of panties? Hmm? The answer is: none of them! Because they're all my top five favorite tattoos. Tho-those colorful designs say something special about the guy sporting one - something like: 'What a good sport!' Yes, tattoos! What style! Who doesn't thrill at seeing that imaginative heart with an arrow through it, stained onto a sailor's solar plexus? Or... hum-hum-hum: a dragon dancing across a dockworker's diaphragm? So, don't put silly stickers in your car window... express yourself with a tattoo! (bip... bip... bip) Why bother with 'My Other Car's a Porsche' [porsh] when your bicep can say 'I've Got a Snake on the Other Arm!' (hahaha) And who needs 'I Love New York' window sticker once you've glimpsed on a building worker's bicep, the simple but classic 'I Love Bricks.'"

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The seventh episode of the second Channel Four season of the Max Headroom talk show featured actor and comedian Howie Mandel.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain complete recordings of both the US and UK broadcasts of this episode.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* Max asks the viewer if they really want to sit down for the next thirty minutes, then lists a few of the things they'll miss if they switch off.
** "Switch off? Okay..."
** The screen goes to a white dot, then black.
* We return to a stereotypical sitcom kitchen set (slide) as Max enters to applause and laughs, doing a generic "Hi honey I'm home" schtick. Then he realizes he's in the wrong show...
* Video: Lulu, "Shout" (ca. 1964 - in color, with "The Luvvers")
* Max sings nonsensical snippets. "Some lyrics just stay with ya."
* Black and white clip of a chef making a rooster crow on command.
* Now Max is at... I said, NOW MAX IS AT THE DISCO!
** Max gets them to turn off the noise and lights, and describes the disco scene.
* More chef and rooster.
* Max has advice for his younger viewers about wearing very tight jeans... not a good idea.
* Video: Love and Rockets, "Yin and Yang (The Flowerpot Man)"
* This week, we're in... Greece! Land of bouzoukis, Zorba, souvlaki and moussaka. And feta. And kebabs.
** Comedy clip from Neil Mullarkey, his "Ghost Train" skit where he simulates a dark, scary ride and tries to scare a seated audience member with rubber bats, spiders and other terrifying items.
* And we're back in Greece. Land of weightlifters (like Nautilus), gods and tragic history.
* Opening credits roll...
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK version only:&lt;/span&gt; Max interrupts, we see the "neon bar" placeholder card  and a few moments of black screen for the Channel Four commercial break.
**&lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt; UK only:&lt;/span&gt; we come back for a somewhat extended take on the opening credits.
** ...until it's suddenly time again for "Quiz!" with no fewer than three rounds of the theme song.
*** and this time Max is ringing the changes and it's completely different because there will be no question, no prizes, no contestants, because we're not gonna play - we're not gonna play - we're not gonna play... Quiz!
* Opening credits conclude.
* In a remote interview (from a TV on Howie's couch), Max and his guest Howie Mandel talk about:
** Max talks about rock stars, actors, actresses and a variety of social diseases... he's had them all. But today he has one of the wildest young comedians around... Mr. Jack Benny!
** No, really, it's Howie "For God's sake don't sit on the front row when I'm onstage" Mandel.
** Howie's live act - it's improv with the audience. 
*** His rubber-glove-on-the-head gag: from "St. Elsewhere" or before? (Before.)
*** Video: Paul Hardcastle, "The Wizard" intro. (Techno synth instrumental.)
** The family suit over his grandmother's hypnosis - a stage magician made her believe she was a chicken and couldn't snap her out of it. (She's almost normal now.)
*** Insert some truly horrid egg puns. (I mean it, horrid. Third-grade. ''Boy's Life. Reader's Digest.'')
** Max spreads himself across all media: singing! dancing! talking! and... 
** Golf! and...
*** Mandel: "I like golf."
*** Max: (stunned) "You like golf?"
*** Mandel used to be a caddy... but there were no golfers.
** Paul Hardcastle, "The Wizard" continues.
** How "How" really embarrasses people - or doesn't - and ''how''.
** Mandel has started stamp collecting as a hobby in his little spare time over the past three years. By next year he'll have... two. Stamps.
** Doing the voice of "Gizmo" in "Gremlins." 
*** Other voices Mandel does in his act.
** The film "Bobo" - Mandel spent nine months on all fours and took a lot of abuse in the role as a dog.
** Max calls Mandel the funniest comedian they've had on the show. (Also the only one... but funnier than Sting.)
** Paul Hardcastle, "The Wizard" concludes.
* Max asks if the viewer is one of the chosen people... a biker. Freedom and sloping foreheads forever! Yee-haw!
* Brief clip of Sylvester Stallone in "Cobra" (1986), answering "Yeah, but it's just a little [attitude problem]."
* Max and Max are back... Max in the green plaid he interviewed Mandel in, and regular Max in a black jacket.
** Black Max tries to introduce the show, while green Max makes goofy faces. Black Max repeatedly tries to get him to stop.
** Black Max wants to sing a song but green Max insists on singing along - "You Gotta Have Happiness."
*** The credits roll fast on a perspective strip underneath the two TVs.
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;US version only:&lt;/span&gt; The Cinemax credit is followed by a short Max riff on having a pet yuppie.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
The introductory riff shows three clips of things to come, one of which is Howie Mandel using one of his strange voices. Another of them - Max doing a strange "German" riff - doesn't appear at all, which becomes entirely consistent with this episode. This show seems rushed throughout, probably in order to fit an extended and oddly respectful interview with Howie Mandel. There are only three videos, one of which is (then!) over twenty years old and two of which appear in very abbreviated form. The end credits are on a high-speed roll under other material, and "Quiz!" is compacted to a here-it-comes/there-it-goes passing gag. In the end, there's next to nothing worth commenting on, other than the interview.

Which is strange, because this is one of the dullest, most predictable interviews of the entire run, with banal banter and tired sallies. It's almost as if Mandel, then at the peak of his fame, had an agreement with the show to be treated more like a regular talk-show host and not as a foil or target for Max. You can practically read the terms in between Max's softball questions and repeated fawning about Mandel's stature as a comedian, and odd "remote" structure of the interview, apparently shot in Mandel's hotel room.

What's even more odd is that they insist Mandel is the first comedian on the show, when it's only three weeks after Tracey Ullman's appearance. That agreement again? Or is it a gender issue - she was just a comedienne? Or was this remote session shot in advance of the Ullman show? In the end, this interview is perfunctory and ignorable, with hardly a worthwhile moment. It all comes off as an example of a minor talent at the very peak of his or her career, insisting on every privilege -  and a struggling show capitulating to catch a hot name in the listings.

Maybe the return concession to Max was for Mandel to be the first guest who says he likes golf?

The brief clip from "Cobra" is entirely in tune here, as that film is often considered to have suffered from Stallone's egotistical control of every detail.

(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (background sound of helicopters) "Are you - are you - sitting down - down? (gibberish) Are you really bothered about sitting here for the next thirty minutes? We've only got this... (shows some clips of the upcoming show) So? Yeah. Me too. Some soda? Yeah."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (Open on still shot of ordinary modern kitchen) (laugh track and applause throughout as Max slides in) "Hi, honey, I'm home! Honey? It's me-me-me! Remember me? Your ''husband''? Okay, honey, I get it: it's the mail-mailman! ...Hey, just a minute! I'm in the wrong damn show! What do you think this is, cheap comedy? [bounces off side of TV frame]"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Hi! I'm at the disco! At the dis-co-co-co! (Could you turn it down, please? ...do you need a talking-to?) Yes, I'm at the disco... or, to be more exact, the perfumed cattle market. Where the dance floor's surrounded by a four-deep wall of guys og-ogl-ogling the girls. The talent: pulling faces and nudging each other like some cats going out on a gang sniff! And I'm not one for being holier-than-thou (much too late for that), but... disco! It should be the hub of sophisticated night life. You know, the nirvana of simple pleasures; the very fulcrum of mutual enjoyment where art and dance are joined together in one glorious united and innocent display of... (tracks something going past with his eyes) Shoo-wah! Hey, check the ass out on that? Heh-heh-heh..."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (background phone ringing throughout) "Just a quick word or two of advice now, for my younger viewers, and it's about wearing very tight jeans. You see, it's not a-not a-not a good idea. [segment suddenly rewinds to "it's about..." then runs forward again.] They can actually stop you having children. Mainly because... it takes so long to get them off."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Ah, Greece! Greece. And of course I'm welcomed as always by the melodic sounds of the Greek bouzouki. (Ah.) Yes-yes-yes, that instrument that conjures of images of sun, sea and bricks bounced across piano strings. That instrument that conjures up that much-loved film 'Zorba the Greek,' starring that much-loved actor Anthony Quinn, who played the much-loved striped horse, Zerbra! ...but actually had slightly less Greek in him than Jackie Onassis. Greece-greece-greece: a country of variety. Like... the music. So, let's hear some different Greek music. (record scratch, then same tune continues) Ah. That's better. Yes, variety. And Greece says it all. Especially if you happen to be looking at your dinner. Here are friendly tavernas, where for lunch there's souvlaki, meat-meatballs, and moussaka. And at dinner time, for a change, you can have souvlaki, meatballs, and moussaka. And the cheeses... the wonderful cheeses! There's the pale and crumbly feta, or there's the rich and creamy... feta. Or how 'bout those delicious white slabs of... feta? Ha! And-and-and most Greek of all, the kebab on a skewer. The best way to get it inside you is to run into a restaurant shouting, 'I'm a Turk! I'm a Turk!'"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Greece is  a land of legends: Achilles, Jason and the Argonauts, and the young weight lifter, Nautilus... who angered the gods by using their gym. Ah-ah-ah. So, they punished him, and he was doomed to ride a Greek moped for all eternity! But-but-but it's a country with a tragic history, and surely its lowest point was when Greece was made into a musical starring John Travolta. It's the land that gave birth to democracy, but such a relaxed, easy-going country that they all got tired of democracy and invited a group of army colonels to come in and rule them for a while, so they didn't have to go out and vote!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Are you one of the chosen people, mah friend? I mean, are you more at home in a greasy leather jacket than a pig in a dirt box? Are your jeans so bad they're on probation? And do your fingernails look like a tomata grow-bag? Well-well-well, if they do, then you must be a biker... and I'm proud to know ya. Because with the wind in your hair, the fun in your face and the flies on your teeth, you boys know what freedom is. And it's that kind of honest freedom to take up all three lanes of a two-lane highway, and have sloping foreheads for low wind resistance. Freedom: to make friends called Gizmo, and Dr. Death, and make enemies, called innocent pedestrians. Do not let them take away the freedom to talk in grunts. Listen boys-listen boys, who needs a language iffen you're wearin' a helmet all day anyhoo? Don't let them take away your right to inspect trucks from a different angle... like from underneath. Or the right to suffer gravel rash. Yes, mah friends, bikes are the closest thing to heaven... and they're movin' you closer to it all the time. Here's revvin' at y'all. Yaaa-hoo!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Now what is all this hoopla about yuppie-yuppie-yuppies? I had a yuppie once, until one day I came home and found it floating belly-up in the tank. Heh-heh-heh... M-Max-Max Headroom (snigger) cht-cht-cht for Cinemax!"

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The eighth episode of the second Channel Four season of the Max Headroom talk show featured veteran actor Jack Lemmon.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain complete recordings of both the US and UK broadcasts of this episode. Charles McGrew's page contains a number of audio clips that precede the Lemmon interview.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* To a black screen, Max opens with an almost uncomfortably sincere prayer that he and this episode succeed. (Other than one stutter, it's completely straightforward.)
* Quick forward-and-reverse clip of the opening titles.
* Max appears in his white jacket... well, his white jacket appears. No Max head.
** "...that's right: I think the electric chair is too good for them."
** Max strikes a serious note about letters received about one of his prior items, and he's going to read one before a giggling crew tells him he has no head.
* Video: Art of Noise, "Close to the Edit" (a variation of the show theme)
* Max watches a clip of a cricket game, gasping and shaking his head in awe.
* Black and white (French?) clip of people Hula-Hooping, late 1950s or so. Insert shots of Max hooping around his neck.
* Max complains about censors cutting his show. (Shows a clip of Jack Lemmon being bleeped, then an attempt to bleep him.)
** "It has no... ''cojones!''"
* Clip of Pat Benatar playing violin very slowly. Cut to Max humming the slowed theme and trying to remember the tune.
** More Art of Noise, "Close to the Edit"
* Comedy clip of "Ra Ra Zoo": a couple pretending to be in a restaurant as the man stuffs his mouth.
* Max in the green plaid comes on, tests the mike, and speaks shyly... it's his first video dating recording. He can't even read his own notes very well...  
* Regular opening sequence roles, with the credit slides cut in to increasingly weird sound effects.
* And this week, we're in... Russia! Land of high technology and blue jeans!
* Video: World Party, "Private Revolution"
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK version only:&lt;/span&gt; cut for commercial break, with THE MAX HEADROOM SHOW placeholder slide.
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK version only:&lt;/span&gt; video continues to same point as US version.
* And we're back in Russia... where goods aren't that crappy and the Afghan Invasion was about coffee.
* Back to "Ra Ra Zoo" as the couple pours tea into cups on their heads.
* Max and his guest Jack Lemmon talk about:
** How some people are born funny, some have to acquire it and some have funniness thrust upon them.
** And his guest was born with funny, having to live with the name Lemmon!
*** Video: Pat Benatar, "Sex as a Weapon" intro.
** Lemmon's dad stuck him with the middle name Uhler, which made him "Jack U. Lemmon"... (Actually, John Uhler Lemmon III...)
*** Lemmon apologizes for taking forty minutes to answer every question.
** Max asks if Lemmon ever considered standup comedy. ("No." - he succeeded as a film comedian early on.)
** Faking having a cold in a movie ("The Apartment") - all acting, and largely improvised.
** Testing the makeup and clothes with Tony Curtis for "Some Like It Hot" by going out into the studio lot ladies' room.
*** But all the clothes were uncomfortable - high heels are killers.
*** Video: Pat Benatar, "Sex as a Weapon" continues.
** Did Lemmon's successful films have a particular ingredient he brought to them? (No, but they were mostly contemporary parts and thus more easily understood.)
** Working with Marilyn Monroe.
** Working with comedy actors - more or less difficult than dramatic actors?
** Max could tell from his earlier comment: golf is Lemmon's game! ("I adore it... because I'm so terrible at it.")
*** Video: Pat Benatar, "Sex as a Weapon" concludes.
* &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;US version only:&lt;/span&gt; Max has some advice for kids only: about petting.
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;US version only:&lt;/span&gt; Short clip of Val Kilmer from "Real Genius" laughing maniacally.
* Max has something to get off his chest: all the stuff about Russia was lies. He tells a lot of lies. But now he's going to tell only the truth. (Damn, he's doing it again...)
* &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;UK version only:&lt;/span&gt; Max does a riff about the university of life, in front of a clip of a woman slowly stripping (Max keeps getting in the way of the good bits.)

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
The country theme for this episode might be "Greece," but the tween-the-lines theme is "censorship." From the opening rant about censorship to the faux reading of a complaint letter to comments here and there to the hilarious (UK only) segment with Max blocking the view of a very nice pair of hooters, the idea of censorship was in the air... whether as a comedy anchor or as a real backlash against censors on one side of the pond, it's hard to say.

The instrumental video from Art of Noise is very "in the family," given Max's connections to the group and their composing of the show's title theme.

&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (Max's white jacket appears, with no Max head) "...that's right, that's right, you're absolutely right: the electric chair is too good for them. ...On a more serious note, I-I-I've received a lot of letters about one item I did, and-and I'm going to read this one to you - it's quite short. ...What? What do you mean it's not on? Of course it is, it's only a letter! ''Ehp''... what's not on? Who was responsible for that? I don't care, just get me off quick, it's damned embarrassing. Yeah, well, I'll find out whose mistake it was... someone's head is gonna roll! Oh, that's it, now gig-gig-giggle. What's so damned funny? It's okay for you lot, ''I'm'' the one that's up there, it's ''my'' face going out... ''now'' what are you laughing at? This is the most unprofessional, amateurish crew I have ever worked with and I..." (cut off)

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Censors! Cutting my damned show in half! Give 'em a p-p-preview and straight away, out comes this (Jack Lemmon: 'That is a piece of s''BLEEP''t') and then 'oh, no, musn't show this' (clip of Max from the 'petting' riff later, being badly and excessively bleeped) and did this slip its innocent little way through the old fine-mesh net? (clip from Pat Benatar video) Oh-oh-oh no, no no! I tell them widdout theez my show, he have no ''cojones''! I said to them:'' 'Cojones!' '' 

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Um... am I on? Testing, testing (blows at the mike) (coughs) Sorry. All right. Uh... Hello. I'm, ah, rather new to video dating but I hope this tape will give you a good pee-pee-peek at me, and what I'm like straight... what I'm like. Straightaway, let me tell you about myself and my favorite hobby. Girls. My favorite hobby, girls, is golf, and I also like to fish skate... to fish, skate, to, uh, windsurf, cook Chinese stamps, um, collecting, of pottery, read, write, wrestle, run, row, and... I like to make lists (giggles) yeah, I'm really fun to have around, 'cuz if I see something amusing I'll make a joke about it as quick as ahh... flash! But don't worry... if you have a date with me, you'll soon want to be in bed most of the time. (coughs) Most of the time we'll go to discos because that's when I'm in my best late at night... Uh, at my best, late at night I get quite excitable... so if you'd like a date with me, send your tape through the agency, and I do hope to meet you... (peers at screen) and... 'don't mention big tits.' "
 
* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Ah... a day's a day, a carefree feeling(?)... where-where-where else could I be but light-hearted and jaunty-o little old Russia. A land where some things just suddenly... vanish: aging politicians, the man next door and the occasional nuclear power station. But now I know you think the Russians are a serious people with no sense of humor, hmm? Well, who could blame them - having been invaded centuries ago by the Tartars, who tried to exterminate them all... an example of sheer Tartar sass. (...Russian joke.) Right-right-right, the point is, the Russians concentrate on modern technology, and they're light years ahead at fixing the hem on bell-bottom jeans and fixing racing steering wheels on tractors. And, of course, fixing the accounts on last year's grain harvest. But yes, it is a country of... fashion. Walking through Moscow with the old astrakhan fur hat at a daring tilt, and... getting frostbite in one ear. But the young Russians are different. They love jeans, and they'll offer to buy jeans off any western tourist - which isn't surprising, living in the nuclear fallout of Chernobyl has made all Russians wish they had different jeans! Ha ha ha! (...that's not a Russian joke.)"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "To the West, Russia is a mysterious country - its power, its motives, the sex of its women shot-putters. But it isn't true that Russian goods are poor-poor. Here, you can buy the very latest thing in personal hi-fis, which come complete with a solid walnut cabinet and six dissidents to carry it around. Plus, a free album of twenty golden funeral marches. And, everyone here is provided with a home... although, of course, in the case of the dissidents, it's a mental home. And finally, the Afghan invasion: an act of aggression? Hah! No! The invasion was caused by a rumor spreading through Moscow that one grocer in Afghanistan had just received a delivery of instant coffee!"

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Did the name 'Lemmon' really give you a problem? I mean, it could have been 'Jack' the kids at school were laughing at..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Jack Lemmon:&lt;/span&gt; "I don't think it's any of your business." [short break for video] "Yes, it did give me a problem, and I really didn't want to speak to my old man, my father, for about ten years. For some oddball reason, it's bad enough with 'Lemmon' as a last name - which actually was pronounced 'leh-mahn' because it's two M's in it..."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "No artistic credibility, nyeh? Leh-MON! Ha!"
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Jack Lemmon:&lt;/span&gt; "He said stick with 'lemon' because at least they'll remember it. But... the middle name that he stuck me with is what really teed me off: Uhler, U-H-L-E-R. So obviously the middle initial is U. For ten years, all I could remember was'' 'Jack You Lemon, Jack You Lemon' ''in school, and I never was willing to forgive my father, who was stuck with the same name."
: &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Okay, well, thanks for helping me out on that one... a little Lemmon-aid. Ha."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Hi. Can I take a few moments to give you some advice? And I think adults can switch off, because this is strictly for kids. ...Have they gone-have they gone? ...Right. Okay, I want to talk to you about... p-p-petting. No, no no no, don't giggle, because I'm worried about whether you think carefully enough before you... do it. It starts at school, right? The occasional innocent stroke and tickle at the end of class, and then you get carried away and you want to go... further. First it's on the desks and then home on the sofa and then it's out in the open in the garden; you don't care and you can't control it and before you know where you are, there's a family on the way. So-so-so, take my advice about petting: just ''think'' before you bring the school rabbit home."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Um, I have a confession to make. Really, uh... I'd like to get this off my che-chest. All that stuff about Russia earlier? I made it all up. All that stuff about six dissidents to carry your hi-fi? It's all lies. In fact, I-I-I tell a lot of lies - all jokes, quips and witticisms are lies, and I get enormous mileage out of them. Well, I've had enough. From now on, I'm telling the truth. And the truth is, I feel damn embarrassed. There, I've said it, and... I feel better already. Who needs lies, anyway? So, thank you for listening, for being so understanding... in fact, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for being such a beau-beautiful, wonderful-wonderful audience... the best! ...damn, I'm doing it again."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (Max bobs around in front of a soft-porn clip of a woman undressing to a synth-rock score) "I'm one of life's thinkers, and that's because I'm a student-I'm a student of the University of Life. And, after all's said and done, life's a funny old business, isn't it? All right, admit it! Every which way you turn, there is a problem round the bend. And, well, there's good and bad-good and bad everywhere you go, and we all know policemen have a very difficult job. But personally, I think the young people of today are marvelous, and if you just take the trouble to look around, you bide your time, you'll find that spring is just around the corner. And even though we do have our ups and downs, what-what-what's this life worth if you can't talk a load of crap once in a while and get... in everybody's... way?"

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The ninth episode of the second Channel Four season of the Max Headroom talk show featured singer/songwriter Jackson Browne.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain a complete recording of the UK broadcast of this episode. Charles McGrew's page contains a number of audio clips that precede the Browne interview.''

==Videos &amp; Segments==
* Max opens with yet another sad close to the the series... that's premature, so never mind.
* Video: Ken Noath, "Junk Mail"
* Max talks about his analyst and other stars who are seeing him.
* Clip of Max on a roller coaster... as he barfs.
* Max, in a Cockney accent, lists all the bits in the show that can't be left out.
* The regular intro begins at double speed, then screeches to a stop.
* We see a silhouette that might be Max against the moving-lines background. The announcer interviews "Alan X" as a "supergrass," or informer on criminal companions.
** Mime Les Bubb does an act as a chicken in the audience.
** Max's "supergrass" interview continues.
** Clip of Val Kilmer from "Real Genius" screaming.
* Regular intro starts again, with a black screen, then no audio, then telephone bleeping. It ends abruptly.
* &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;Probably UK only:&lt;/span&gt; Cut to Max sobbing at the audience. It's time to say goodbye to the audience at home... so they can really let their hair down in the studio. The audience chants goodbye, then starts partying.
** &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;Probably UK only:&lt;/span&gt; Cut to THE MAX HEADROOM SHOW placeholder title.
* Regular intro runs normally, from the beginning, but cuts the last few seconds to go to...
* This week's visit, to the Middle East! 
** Video: Jackie Wilson, "Reet Petite" (claymation) begins
* And we're back in the Middle East.
** Jackie Wilson, "Reet Petite" continues.
* Max finds himself on one side of a stage in a mystery theater in London, where a band is set up to perform. He calls over his guest of the week...
* Max and his guest Jackson Browne talk about:
** His name (actually ''Clyde'' Jackson Browne)
** Being political in his songs in the US. He still writes introspective songs, but has become aware of bigger issues.
** What does he do outside of music and working? ("I don't do anything...")
** Max is waiting to hear a simple little word... (Browne: "Golf." Max: "That's not the word.")
*** Black and white montage clip of "Bathing Beauties."
** Browne tries, "Cook?" "That's not the one..." Max guides him back to golf, but Browne doesn't golf.
*** Video: Elton John, "Heartache All Over The World" begins.
** Politics and getting arrested.
** The environment (like golf courses).
** His taste in TV (like Max's Coke commercial, or show).
** Max thanks Browne and promises to sing a song with him next time.
*** Video: Elton John, "Heartache All Over The World" continues .
* Over the closing credits, Max rants about yet another letter of complaint from the SPCI - the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Insects. It seems that golf kills millions of insects a year... so Max isn't going to say another word about golf.
* Black and white clip of old fashioned bicycle racing.
* And it's time again for... Quiz!
** Max shuts up the munchkin singers on the repeat.
** Tonight there are three lucky seats with lucky winners in them, who want to be Sexist of the Series!
** The contestants are David, James and Robert!
*** But there's no winners and no prizes this time.

==Notes &amp; Commentary==
A "supergrass" is a British term for a high-level criminal informant, evolved from a "grass," which was any snitch inside a gang. It first came into use to describe the ranking IRA members who testified against others, often anonymously.

Jackson Browne's full name is Clyde Jackson Browne. His father was... Clyde Jack Browne.

&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;
(''Max's speech in this season finally stops using the extreme stuttering and repetition, probably as much for technical, audience and production reasons as because it was getting tiresome. I am still trimming such repetitions to minimum indicators here in the transcriptions.'')

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; (sound of sirens in the background throughout) "Yes, it's the end of this long series, and we've got to know each other closely, warmly... intimately. And you and I have ''felt'' and moved each other, we've touched each other, we've caressed, we've fondled, we've played with each others' skirt, each others' intimate bits, we've... rough-rough-roughed over sensitive parts together and gone ''pah-pah-pah''... you expect me now to say to you, with all the sincerity I can lay my shoulders on, well, that's it. It's time to close the account, bring the old curtain down, sweep the stage, clear the last used cotton bud from the old dressing room table, but...  I'm not trying to say all those sad, silly, sentimental things because... we've still got another show to do."

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "Okay, so what? What's in it - I am not proud, I admit it. The world of entertainment is full of insecure people. And it's true: I ''do'' see an analyst, okay? He comes to see me every Tuesday. They call him Professor Showbiz, "Analyst to the Stars," and I'm not one for tittle-tattle tittle-tattle, but some of the things he's told me... Like with Liz Taylor - he was just on the verge of finding out whether she was a compulsive eater when she stole at his notes. But he's very good, he carefully strips away the littles of the mind. It can take years. Although with Sylvester Stallone, he reckoned it took three minutes. And he does all that stuff where he takes you back to childhood. With Joan Collins, it's turning out to be a very long trip. Kate Bush is a regular; she saw him last week and he was horrified when she suddenly started reliving some terrible trauma... and then realized she's just singing. But-but-but I guess his prize patient at the moment is... Madonna. She wanted to know whether she  had chewed gum in a former life, and she responded well. Under hypnosis, she managed to keep her ankles together for seven minutes."

{{FlickerBar|[[Episode CH4.0.1: The Origin Telefilm]]|[[Episode CH4.1.1]]}}

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;When the origin telefilm was shown on the US Cinemax channel, it was extended by almost a half hour of additional videos and a few extended scenes.&lt;/div&gt;

''The MaxRchives contain a complete recording of this telefilm.''

This page is an appendix to the [[Episode CH4.0.1: The Origin Telefilm | main telefilm page]] and lists only the changes between the two versions.

The extended version was apparently created and edited to run as four weekly episodes on Cinemax, running in parallel with the later episodes of the UK-import Max Talking Headroom Show. There may or may not be any "official" full length edit of this version, and fan-made single edits in circulation may have variations. Whoever made the extended version had access to original footage shot for the first version, as several scenes not in the original appear in this version.

==Summary==
This version of the telefilm was apparently assembled for Max's debut on the US cable channel Cinemax. It comprises the original telefilm with almost 25 minutes of added Max riffs, video introductions and videos - all purportedly coming from his appearance on Big Time Television, but actually clipped from the UK talk &amp; music show that followed the UK telefilm.

In most places, the new material is inserted in place of or along with the shorter Max repartee of the original. Instead of a short exchange with the Network 23 board in which he accuses them of ex-ex-executing audiences, for example, there is a much longer presentation of Max riffing, and a video, before Grosman explodes in fury.

There are numerous small cuts from the original film, mostly of Max riffing (which is replaced in most instances by other Max riffs and/or the inserted videos). There are also two interesting additions. First is the "Cinemax Presents" credit that leads off the film, ahead of the Matt Frewer and Nickolas Grace credits.

The second addition is a 16-second clip that goes between Cheviot telling Grosman that he would do something about blipverts, and the scene of Carter and Theora reassembling Carter's camera. While the intimacy of the latter scene implies that the two shared something more than a towel, the added 16 seconds makes it explicit. We see Theora pouring a cup of something hot - tea, coffee, some 20-minute-from-now substitute - and taking it to Carter in bed... who then begins to peel Theora out of her robe as the scene fades.

The history of this small snippet is not clear. It seemed familiar to me even though I had not (knowingly) seen the extended version before, so it may be in some releases or broadcasts of the telefilm. It is not in the studio released videotape version. It seems most likely that it was cut from the released version at some early point, but survived in the master given Cinemax for exiting. Although brief, it does make the overall apartment scene between Carter and Theora much more explicit, and creates a sharp contradiction to the series, in which the two are not lovers.

All of the remaining 25 minute extension is added Max material, and videos - videos that are in current play in 1985-6, but are presented as Blank Reg's old free junk in the telefilm.

The editing is somewhat rough, with several duplicated snippets. (For example, the "'Just because they're free doesn't mean they're good' - 'I like	them!'" exchange appears, jarringly, twice within a few minutes, and reaction shots of the board listening to Max are repeated as well.) There are no credits for the re-editing or for any of the videos (except a credit line at the end of one of the videos).
==Timeline of Changes==
A complete summary of the changed and added material is as follows (times are approximate):

* '''00:00 -''' "Cinemax Presents" credit.
* '''44:37 -''' Added scene (right before Carter and Theora fix Carter's camera): Theora serves Carter tea and then herself (16s).
* '''47:09 -''' Added scene (right after Dominique says Max could have his own show): Max introduces himself, with interference from Reg, and finally gets someone to run the video "Is That Love" by Squeeze	(3m 20s).
* '''50:30 -''' Added scene (immediately follows Squeeze video): Max riffs on "Dallas" and "Dynasty" being Russian plots, then shows the video "Do You Dream in Colour" by Bill Nelson (3m 48s).
* '''54:18 -''' Added scene (immediately follows the Nelson video): Max riffs on the Iran-Iraq war, then shows the video "Radio Ga Ga" by Queen (3m 44s).
* '''58:02 -''' Added scene (immediate follows the Queen video: Max riffs about starting a band, then shows the video "Walking to the Beat" by Yakihiro Takahashi (2m 23s).
* '''60:25 -''' Edited scene (immediately follows Takahashi video: After Reg says "Go for it, Max, you son of a bitch!" the snip of Max asking, "I beg your pardon?" is repeated, then Reg's line "Go for it."
* '''61:45 -''' Added scene (when Bryce says "explain this"): Max riffs on Mozart, then shows the video "Aikea Quinea" by the Cocteau Twins (2m 34s).
* '''64:04 -''' Added scene (immediately follows Cocteau video): Max tells a joke about a sexual complaint, then shows the video "Turning Japanese" by The Vapours(1m 50s).
* '''68:25 -''' Added scene (after Reg says "How come he's got a sense of humor?"): Max shows the video "Making Plans for Nigel" by XTC (2m 45s).
* '''72:25 -''' Changed/added scene (as the Network 23 board notices Big Time TV's rapid ratings climb): Max's interaction with the board is replaced by other material, intercut with repeated reaction shots of the board from the original sequence. Max does a riff on flip-flops, then shows the video "Free Yourself" by the Untouchables. He then riffs on nuclear pollution, and on the "funny lines" behind him. (4m 12s).
* '''81:38 -''' Added scene (immediately after final credits): A voiceover leads into a final Max riff introducing his new show, and his first interview with Sting. (50s).

A great deal of this material seems to be re-purposed from the earlier versions of the Channel Four and Cinemax talk/video shows. A complete review of this summary is forthcoming now that most of those shows are available on YouTube or in the MaxRchives.

[[File:mhcom_matt_frewer_1000.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Matt Frewer as Edison Carter, ca. 1986]]
&lt;br clear=all /&gt;
'''Matt Frewer''' is a Canadian-American actor who is perhaps most famous for portraying [[Max Headroom]] and his human counterpart, news reporter [[Edison Carter]]. Besides this defining dual role, Frewer has played more than a hundred film and television roles including lead or regular characters on ''Eureka'', ''Doctor Doctor'', ''Falling Skies'' and ''Orphan Black'', and signature film roles such as Sherlock Holmes and "Moloch" in ''Watchmen''.

===Biography===
Frewer was born in Washington DC to a Royal Canadian Navy officer and his wife, and raised in Petersborough, Ontario.

===Casting &amp; Involvement with Max Headroom===
Frewer was selected for the role of Max Headroom in part because his mix of US, Canadian and English acting experience gave him the ambiguous "mid-Atlantic" accent and appearance the show developers wanted for their lead.</ns0:text>

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4883">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;Max Headroom was basically born as an advertising avatar, to promote both the new Channel Four and his own initial show. He has been used by a number of advertisers since, including a late return to Channel Four.&lt;/div&gt;

Data on Max's advertising appearances is incomplete, and updates and additional information are solicited!

==Channel Four / The Max Headroom Show (1985-1987)==
The original purpose of Max was to draw attention to the UK's Channel Four and his own talk/video show thereon. There's not much more to say about that, as everything that followed is documented throughout this site.

Very much a case of "the medium is the message" - except that Max was more of a l-large than a medium.

==The New Coke Campaign (1986)==
Let's just-just get this out of the way: If someone knows Max for just one thing, it's either the ABC series or the massive advertising campaign for the second rollout of "New Coke." The intersection of Max and New Coke is so large and significant that it's been assigned its own (developing) [[Max: The New Coke Campaign | subsection]] here on the site.

==Radio Rentals (1986)==
[[File:Mhcom_max_radiorentals_ad.jpg|right|frame|Ad from the ''Record Mail'', 19 July 1986. George is a common enough name (including Matt Frewer's middle one), but I like to think Max is referring to his creator, George Stone.]]
Despite being the most obvious and available product pitchman of his era, Max's only straight-out gig for a general consumer product — other than Coke — was his appearance in television and print ads for Radio Rentals, a TV-rental service in the UK. A print ad, which strongly resembles a storyboard for a video commercial, appeared in UK newspapers.

There were also four television advertisements, none of which followed that storyboard, oddly enough. The ads were reportedly produced by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, and followed the visual format of the video/talk shows, especially the full-screen titles.

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Channel Four Digital (2007)==
[[File:Mhcom_old_max_headroom.jpg|frame|right]]
When Channel Four and its subsidiary channels (and how ''very'' "twenty minutes" that is) were prepared to switch over to digital service, they hauled Max out of cold storage and used him in a series of ads promoting the change. Six ads, running from about five seconds in length to just over a full minute, were produced in late 2007 and rolled out on December 1, 2007.

Original producer/director Rocky Morton was called in for the project, along with Matt Frewer in his first return to Max makeup since 1989. Max was given new "old age" prosthetics, makeup and effects, and presented as being in a retirement home in his old-fashioned, six-channel tube TV.

Max being Max, he was of course angry, bitter and a little foulmouthed at being retired and forgotten, and even more so over having been ignored about telling everyone about the digital TV revolution twenty years earlier. Fortunately, his aide Darren is patient with him. (Watching the ads, you have to wonder how much of the bitterness is scripted, and how much is genuine with Matt Frewer...)

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14986">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;In four seasons of two video, entertainment and talk shows on two channels in two countries, Max Headroom had a number of extremely high-profile guests. This page lists all of them and the shows on which they appeared.&lt;/div&gt;

I have not found any good reason to index the video performers and songs. However, they are all listed in the various show entries and can be found by a site search.

===Notes===
* The two appearances by Sting are the same interview with slightly different edits.
* Despite persistent references to the contrary, Luis Cardenas was never a guest on any Max show. He did have a video on a Season 3 show.

==Performers==
In addition to big-name interview guests, the shows often had other performers appear - but under restricted conditions. These performances were all oddball comedy skits, shown as framed video clips shot on the show set and often involving the audience. They were never shown as a linear part of the show and may have been audience warmup acts given a small segment of airtime in compensation - or, if amusing and bizarre enough, to fill out the show.

Max's specific comedy skits (as distinct from his usual in-form video riffs) are included here as well.

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21386">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;A satirist must often suffer the same slings and arrows in return. Max Headroom has been parodied, satirized and paid homage in a surprisingly broad variety of ways.&lt;/div&gt;

==David Letterman: "Larry Bud Headroom" (September &amp; October 1986)==
[[File:mhcom_letterman_larrybudheadroom.jpg|frame|right|David Letterman of Network 66 unveils his answer to Max.]]
A few months after [[Max: Interviews &amp; Appearances#David Letterman Interview (1986) | David Letterman had Max as a guest on his show]], he jumped into signature parody mode and brought out "Larry Bud Headroom" - his regular "court jester" Larry Bud Melman (played by Calvert DeForest) transformed into a computer-generated talking head. More than just a brief joke, Letterman gave over a significant segment of his show to parody Max's talk show, with his "Headroom" answering audience questions and giving away absurd gifts (a package of fluorescent light tubes).

{| class="t_links_l"

{| class="t_links_l"
| [[File:mhcom_youtube_icon_100.png|60px|link=https://youtu.be/ix4xwJyHT-g?t=13m26s]]&lt;br /&gt;"Larry Bud Headroom" on Letterman,&lt;br /&gt;8 Oct 1986 (begins at 13:26)
|}

Letterman ran the skit twice, once on September 15, 1986, and then again on October 8. The first appearance had a very approximate version of Max's background (mostly neon-green stripes), while the second one used a bouncing lines background that may well have been borrowed from the ABC series video archive.

The joke does not appear to have been repeated a third time, and even Letterman alludes to the waning popularity of Max humor in the introduction to the second.

Tracey Ullman (with her baby) was a guest on the October show, and had been a guest on Max's show just weeks before.

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Neil Young: "Pressure" (1986)==
It's hard to imagine a singer/songwriter who would be less affected by the Max phenomenon than Neil Young, and something of a tribute to Max's pervasive influence that Young referenced him in a song on the "Landing on Water" album, released on July 28, 1986. It's much more homage than parody, but the lyrics about the pressures of television influence and its drive of consumerism - at least, as I read them - include:

:: ''You watch the box and the video jocks&lt;br/&gt;If you could talk that could even be you up there&lt;br/&gt;That's why you need &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;'''Max Headroom'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too much pressure for peace on earth&lt;br/&gt;Too much tryin' to get your money's worth&lt;br/&gt;Too much dying&lt;br/&gt;The eldorado, the mercedes benz&lt;br/&gt;The job security that never ends.''

The lyrics sheet has it as three words - "max head room" - but the song clearly pronounces it as Max's name. The associated video, directed by Tim Pope, also has a very Max-like vibe in Young's performance - if Max had existed around 1940.

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

=="Maxine Legroom" (January 1987)==
[[File:Mhcom_maxine_legroom-censored.jpg|frame|right|Maxine Legroom, tastefully cen-cen-censored here.]]
When Max was [[Max: Interviews &amp; Appearances#Playboy: 20 Questions for Max Headroom (January 1987) | interviewed for ''Playboy'' magazine]], the editors accompanied the interview with a layout for a rather hot blonde (female, of course) equivalent named Maxine Legroom. It's an absurd self-parody of their usual Playmate pictorials, complete with a "biography" listing Maxine's interests. It ran under the subtitle, "Max, have we got a girl for you!"

The model was ''Playboy'' regular Sondra (Sandy) Greenberg, who also appeared in ''Playboy Video Magazine #12'', doing four Max-like segments. I haven't seen those yet...

(There is also a series of workout videos under the "Maxine Legroom" name, but if there's a connection - to either Max or this Maxine - it's escaped me.)

&lt;div class="inlinecite"&gt;This issue of Playboy is in the MaxRchives; inquiries about the pictorial and interview are welcome.&lt;/div&gt;

=='''MAD Magazine''' (March 1987-1990)==
[[File:mhcom_mad_cover_3-87.jpg|frame|left|(March 1987) One of Max's two national magazine covers - this and ''Newsweek'' appeared within almost the same publication month.]]
[[File:mhcom_mad_sidebar_3-87.jpg|frame|right|The inside content of the March 1987 issue.]]
[[File:mhcom_mad_comment_9-87.jpg|frame|left|(September 1987) The on-the-heels ''Newsweek'' cover did not escape MAD's editors. (''Newsweek'' even had MAD's cover in their writeup!)]]
[[File:mhcom_mad_golf_12-87.jpg|frame|right|(December 1987) Max's strange obsession with golf irritated even MAD's readership.]]
[[File:mhcom_mad_max_donjohnson-4-88.jpg|frame|left|(March 1988) This comparison of Max and Don Johnson had special sting in that "Miami Vice" was one of the two shows that tanked time-slot companion Max's ratings.]]
[[File:mhcom_mad_shrunk_kids-1-90.jpg|frame|right|(January 1990) Max's last appearance in MAD was this jab at Matt Frewer's difficulty in moving on to other roles.]]
Max famously appeared on the cover of the March 1987 issue of MAD, albeit wearing his Alfred E. Neuman mask. An inside sidebar was the only related content, showing that the decision to go with Max was probably a late decision by The Usual Gang of Idiots.

MAD ran a few Max items over the next few years, probably stuff that was in hand, in prep or in press as Max started to fade from the scene. Most are fairly sharp, even unkind observations... but still funny.

(Ah, MAD, I miss you...)

==Doonesbury &amp;amp; "Ron Headrest" (April 1987-1993)==
[[File:Mhcom_ronheadreststrips.jpg|frame|right|The first two "Ron Headrest" strips from April 27 &amp; April 28, 1987.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:70%;"&gt;''Doonesbury ©1987 G.B. Trudeau. Reprinted courtesy of the creator and Universal Press Syndicate. All rights reserved.''&lt;/span&gt;]]
Gary Trudeau was one of many comics artists to latch onto the Max meme, turning then-President Ronald Reagan into a digitized parody of himself, Ron Headrest. The gag outlived Max's run, as well as Reagan's. "Ron Headrest" makes 77 appearances through about 1993, which (subscribers only, sorry) can find in the GoComics.com online archives.

Garry Trudeau is quoted as saying that this was one of his least popular characters... but damn if it isn't the most spot-on parody of them all. Trudeau clearly "got" what made Max interesting and a little scary, and found the ideal candidate to carry the joke...

&lt;div class="inlinecite"&gt;My thanks to Garry Trudeau and UPS for permitting me to include these sample strips.&lt;/div&gt;

==''The Dingo Principle'' (April-June 1987)==
[[File:MHCOM_The_Dingo_Principle_1987.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Australian PM Bob Hawke Max-Max-Maxified.]]
This short-lived, extremely hard-hitting Australian political satire show, loosely modeled on a television news format, lasted just ten episodes amid uproar that reached the Australian Parliament and caused international repercussions. Its working motto was "Every Bastard For Themselves."

{| class="t_links_l"

It's thus not surprising that it had a Max-like vibe in its theme music, titles and presentation, extending all the way to a Maxified presentation of then Prime Minister Robert Hawke.

&lt;div class="inlinecite"&gt;Thanks here to Blank Andrew from downunda for bringing this forgotten gem to my attention.&lt;/div&gt;

==''Sledge Hammer'': "A Clockwork Hammer" (September 1987)==
[[File:mhcom_sledge_max_animated.gif|frame|right|"Sledge Hammer" being processed by a "Clockwork Orange"-like system to become an uncontrollable AI strangely similar to someone we know.]]
This sitcom was a running parody of tough-guy cop shows, especially "Mike Hammer," and ran on ABC in the same years as Max's show. It was fueled by the broad humor of a punning title that used "sledge," "hammer" or both to establish a parodic theme for each episode of its two-season run. It is probably inevitable that an episode would be based on the title character becoming Max-Max-Maxified.

Some reports have the episode, which premiered on September 17, 1987, originally being titled "Max Sledgeroom" and being much more Max-focused. Objections from either the Max Headroom producers or parent ABC turned the episode as-run into a mashup of star David Rasche's over-the-top Mike Hammer parody, elements of Max, and added elements from the film ''A Clockwork Orange''.

The Max-ish elements included the evil head of another network, VVC, "Landon Smartikoff" - a very blunt swipe at NBC's young and very successful programming head Brandon Tartikoff; ''Max Headroom'' had been prevented from naming the net of Network 66 Brandon Grosman/Grossberg but somehow this briefer, lighter poke was allowed to pass. There are also sneers at the notion of a "fourth network" coming along... in the earliest years of Fox, which no one in the industry thought could crack the monopoly of ABC-CBS-NBC (and poor stepchild PBS). Had they only kn-known...

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Sesame Street (1987-8)==
[[File:Mhcom_max_hogroom.jpg|frame|right|Mup-Mup-Muppet M-Max. What a ''ham''.]]
Along with his [[Max: Interviews &amp; Appearances#Max on Sesame Street (1988) | brief appearance reciting the al-al-alphabet]], Max made two appearances in the Muppet universe.

* '''"Muppet Babies: 'This Little Piggy Went to Hollywood'"''' (1987)
:: Max was &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Max_Headroom briefly impersonated as 'the weirdest guy on TV'] by 'Baby Gonzo' in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_406:_This_Little_Piggy_Went_to_Hollywood Episode 406 of "Muppet Babies,"] 24 Oct 1987.
* '''Sesame Street Magazine''' (1988)
:: Max was portrayed as &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Max_Headroom "Max Hogroom,"]&lt;/span&gt; by 'Link Hogthrob' in the Spring 1988 issue of ''Sesame Street'' magazine.

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==''Maxine'' (1988)==
[[File:Mhcom_maxine_video.jpg|frame|right|''Maxine'': Allison Carter gets dig-dig-digitized, in more ways than one.]]
It's &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_34_%28Internet_meme%29 Rule 34]&lt;/span&gt; before anyone conceived of a Rule 34, much less an internet. Yes, it's Max-themed porn starring Porsche Lynn as both Allison Carter and Maxine Bedroom.

Gawd help me, here's a synopsis:
:"Porsche Lynn stars as Maxine, an intrepid reporter for a busy metropolitan TV news show. She's hit upon the story of a lifetime when she meets a couple of couch potatoes who claim that by watching network television that were turned into a pair of feverishly frolicking sexual animals. Rather than just enjoy the situation, though, the couple feels the need to expose the networks nefarious scheme — to entice viewers into sex through subliminal manipulation. How causing sex among your viewers is supposed to boost ratings is a mystery, but Maxine lays bare the whole sordid story on her nightly broadcast. But now she's run afoul of the powerful network execs who created the whole plan! They plot to assassinate Maxine, but little do they suspect that her personality will be transplanted into the network's own central computer. She becomes more powerful than ever, beaming her sexy shenanigans into homes from coast to coast. A take-off on the one-time hit series 'Max Headroom,' this video uses flashly effects, gorgeous women and plenty of white-hot action to keep you intrigued from start to fiery finish. It's a cyber-sexual trip to the far side of sexual bliss — a trip you'll be happy to take again and again."

==''Back to the Future II'' (1989)==
[[File:Mhcom_maxhead_reagan.jpg|frame|right|''Back to the Future II'': Ronald Rea-Rea-Reagan (Jay Koch).]]
The second installment of the time-traveling movie franchise took Marty McFly to, uh... 2015, where among our flying cars, rehydrated food and other wonders he encountered several Max-like characters on the service screens of the old diner.

(''I have to say that I am beyond embarrassed not to have realized, until it was pointed out to me, that in an additional layer of satire these t-talking heads were pitching The P-Word... Pepsi.''

''Excuse me, I'm going to go ride my hoverboard around to look for flying cars and self-lacing shoes...'')

[[File:mhcom_carmensandiego_chief2.jpg|frame|right]]
[[File:mhcom_carmensandiego_chief3.jpg|frame|right]]
The animated series based on the popular geography-exploring computer games featured Carmen's boss, the Chief. Although he was supposed to be a real person who had once worked with the nefarious Carmen, he was only seen as a talking head on TV, with some very Max-like tics.

He may well have been a mashup of Max and the mysterious "Charlie" of ''Charlie's Angels'' - supposedly running things but never seen by either the audience or the women of his detective agency.

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

In what is regarded as the nadir of the Batman film franchise, director Joel Schumacher shoehorned in a brief Max reference as an AI made from Alfred Pennyworth's computerized mind.

(It made me laugh when I saw it, but the movie still stank.)

==T-Mobile Germany's "Robert T-Online" (2001-3)==
[[File:mhcom_roberttonline_tv.jpg|right|frame]]
One of the more bizarre Max spin-offs was the use of a very Max-like character to pitch Deutsche Telekom's mobile service, branded T-Mobile after the US service of the same name, logo and signature color (magenta).
Unlike Max, "Robert T-Online" was a full-figure character with hands and arms and legs and everything, but otherwise, he was the same kind of strange plasticky robot/computer image avatar. Like Max, he was portrayed by an actor in prosthetics, Matthias Kostya, and with additional video processing.

[[File:mhcom_roberttonline.jpg|right|frame]]
In 2002, he appeared in a television ad with the well-known VJ/presenter Enie van de Meiklokjes, who was known for her bright red-dyed hair (much like that of "Lola" in ''Lola Rennt / Run Lola Run''). For the commercial, her hair was T-Mobile's trademark magenta instead.

Rebranding of T-Mobile as T-Com in 2003 brought the "annoying" spokesbeing to an end.

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Channel Four "Get Ready for Digital" ads (2007)==
It's worth noting here that the 2007 [[Max: Advertising#Channel Four Digital (2007) | Channel Four ads]] could be called parodies... or at least self-satire.

==Music Videos==
For some reason, Max and his stuttering-head trope continue to be popular on the music video scene...
* In the Gigi D'Agostino's video for "Another Way" (1999), the main character resembles Max's appearance and movements. However, as a full-body figure with gloved hands, and appearing in a European artist's video, "Robert T-Online" might have been the more relevant influence.
* The Canadian band Sum 41 wrote and performed a song called "Second Chance for Max Headroom" on their album "Half Hour of Power" (2000). The lyrics have no connection to Max, though.
* In the beginning of Tony Yayo's video for "Pass the Patron" (2010), 50 Cent appears as a Max Headroom-like character who drags two nerds (Yayo and another band member) into the video.
* Selena Gomez appears as a Max-like character on video screens in her video, "Love You like a Love Song" (2011).
* Eminem's single "Rap God" (2013) features an extended homage to Max with the singer in full costume and on a signature moving-lines background, and seen in stacks of old-style TVs.
* &lt;span class="texthighlight"&gt;'''NEW!'''&lt;/span&gt; - UK band Muse has released a video for their 2018 song "Dig Down" that features not just a Max Headroom impersonation, but one based closely on the [[Max: Writeups &amp; Retrospectives#"The Mystery of the Creepiest Television Hack" | 1987 TV piracy video]] (complete with corrugated aluminum backdrop). (''Thanks to Blank Anna for this item!'')

==Cultural Appearances==
[[File:mhcom_davro_as_max.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Bobby Davro as Max.]]
* In 1986, British comedian and impressionist Bobby Davro did a Max Headroom parody as part of one of his shows on ITV. (Date and show uncertain.)

* Max Headroom was used as the model for a famous [[Max: Writeups &amp; Retrospectives#"The Mystery of the Creepiest Television Hack" | 1987 TV piracy incident]] in Chicago.

* On September 11, 2008, the internet group Anonymous posted a &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ZFow_9vsg video]&lt;/span&gt; on YouTube, continuing the "Project Chanology" attack on the Church of Scientology. An armless figure wearing Anonymous's trademark Guy Fawkes mask breaks into a recorded Scientology address and delivers threats to Scientology in a stuttering, processed voice on a Max-like background.

* Max is mentioned in the episode &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQOZ6jrodO8 ''"Diary #4"'']&lt;/span&gt; of the Neely Comics YouTube video series ''Baby Cakes''.

* The YA TV series ''Eerie, Indiana'', in its third episode, ''"The ATM with the Heart of Gold,"'' had a spoof of Max as "Mr. Wilson," the talking head in a "friendly" ATM. (Matt Frewer appeared in a later episode written by ABC series story editor and writer Michael Cassutt.)

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12480">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;Like all series that are cancelled abruptly, ''Max Headroom'' had a number of episodes somewhere in development or production at the time the ax fell.&lt;/div&gt;

The series was renewed for a second season of 13 episodes, and sources have told me that there were full treatments, if not developing or developed scripts, for all the planned episodes. That means that at least five unproduced scripts exist, as well as others that were discarded at some point in the development process.

Here are the details that are known. With luck, more material will become available some day.
: '''Note:''' Contrary to the widely-believed rumor (found even on IMDb), William Gibson never wrote nor planned to write an episode. This comes from a show authority who is well-acquainted with Gibson.

=="Families"==
''Written by Michael Cassutt.''

In production at the time of cancellation. It seems likely that there is footage from this episode, but as all film footage for the series is "lost," finding it is unlikely.

=="Theora's Tale"==
''Story by Eric Blakeney. Teleplay by Steve Roberts.''

In preproduction at the time of cancellation. If the synopsis below is even a rough early draft, it would have been an audacious episode in both production and story development terms.

===Synopsis===
The script became publicly available, and a synopsis was widely posted on Usenet in the mid-1990s. Full credit to the synopsis author Joe Struss, whom I've been unable to contact in recent years.

====Act I====
: At dawn twenty minutes into the future the story opens as two super-nationals ZikZak and Zlin have started a shooting War in Antarctica over mineral zones. Meanwhile Theora is violently kidnapped from her bed by two well-equipped mercenaries (Billig and Slauson) who seem to derive sadistic pleasure from her terror. At Network 23, all hell is breaking loose over the Antarctic Super-National War which has easily become the biggest news story in years. Murray readies Edison in arctic gear as Edison bemoans that fact that Theora has yet to arrive at Network 23. Murray hurries Edison to the special newsperson Air Corridor Antarctic Jet shuttle telling him not to worry and then engages Bryce to find out what has happened to Theora. Bryce illegally uses Max and the two-way sampler to search Theora's apartment. Bryce finds the apartment to be in shambles and finds the doorway has been burned out. The Act ends with the sight of Theora bound and gagged in semi-darkness in the back of a hot and humid van as the van hits a bump and Theora careens into the side of the van.

====Act II====
: Theora is taken out of the van by her captors and marched to a featureless building in midst of a barren, sandy wasteland. Murray tries to calm Edison who is about to board the Air Corridor shuttle while Max berates Murray for not telling Edison the whole truth about Theora and Cheviot berates Murray for not moving quicker on the hottest story in years. Meanwhile Theora is put into a small, dirty cage and a beautiful woman mercenary (Borgia) tortures Theora with sudden loud noises and nail-on-blackboard sounds at high volume. Borgia keeps insisting that Theora's name is Simone and punishes her with noise when she denies this fact. Meanwhile Cheviot, who is busily watching over potential advertising sales from the War coverage, gets a vidcall from Borgia who demands twenty million credits for Theora's release. Cheviot contacts Murray regarding the ransom and wonders aloud how a simple controller can be worth that much. Murray again decides not to contact Edison regarding Theora's ransom. Suddenly a new report comes that states that the special Air Corridor flight has been shot down killing all aboard. Edison Carter is listed amongst the dead. We then see Theora all alone in her grimy little cell pulling helplessly against the bars. Her dirty and bruised face is almost in tears. Back at network 23, a call comes in for Cheviot. It seems that John Best (Chairman of Channel 2) wants to talk to him privately about what has happened to Theora. Cheviot asks Best why he is interested in the well-being of one of his controllers and Best replies by saying, "Because Theora is my daughter".

====Act III &amp; IV====
: Billig and Slauson push, shove and drag Theora around a bare room and eventually drag her out a barred door. Best invites Cheviot to his mansion to speak with him mentioning that there might be something at stake here that is even bigger than the war. Best tells Cheviot that Theora is his adopted daughter. Best adopted a boy and a girl. (The boy does not seem to be Theora's biological brother from the Rakers episode.) Best goes on to describe Theora's childhood in his large mansion and estate, her adopted brother, her fierce independence which caused her to refuse most of his gifts and presents and which eventually led her to a working class life as a controller. During this, Bryce contacts his hacker friends at other networks and sets about doing the near impossible task of tracking down Theora. Bryce's friends both know and like Theora and eventually Bryce hooks together much of the informational power of nearly all the networks (except 66, who refuses to cooperate). Borgia calls Theora a little rich brat and frightens her with black birds that terrify Theora. She imprisons Theora again in darkness and Theora seems as though she is ready to crack as she calls out in fear as loud black bird fluttering sounds are heard in the darkness. Time passes. Theora is later seen as she kicks over her bathroom bucket. Borgia appears as a face in hundreds of images on a video wall and taunts Theora for being a dirty, little girl. Borgia's face is replaced by a news story about the crashed Air Corridor flight. The story lists Edison amongst the passengers who were killed. Theora cracks and begins blubbering and then begins automatically obeying all her captors orders.

: Back at network 23, the War is heating up and Edison pops into the network to tell them that he accidentally missed his flight because he was worried about Theora. Murray gives Edison the latest news some of which he must have gotten from Cheviot. Edison contacts a mercenary assassin friend of his named Kurt who looks and sounds like Von Sidow in 'Three Days of the Condor'. Cheviot over the video link and after a little debate allows Murray and Edison a small team to look for Theora. Theora is seen being physically abused by Billig. She is emotionless. Then further mental abuse by Borgia. She doesn't react to it. Eventually Slauson cleans her up, puts her into a VFA jumpsuit and asks her to join the VFA (Video Freedom Alliance) to fight against the monopolistic network system that sustains leeches like her father. Theora timidly agrees and is given a rifle but is carefully watched by the other revolutionaries. Borgia indoctrinates Theora(Simone) into their cause and teaches her their ways of terrorism. Edison, meanwhile, is combing Theora's apartment with Max looking for some clue to help Bryce finally locate Theora. He comes across an address book with names and address of many network owners/chairpeople. Carter tells Cheviot this and Cheviot comes clean about Theora's past. Cheviot then reveals that Theora because of her rich father knows many vital secrets about the network monopolies and hints that if these secrets were to leak out that mass chaos and hysteria could result. Cheviot then invites Edison to the Best estate. Meanwhile Theora's training is almost complete and she seems happy about her new calling in life though she doesn't handle a rifle well at all. Theora agrees to make a new video communication and will demand the same money for her silence instead of for her release since she has now joined the VFA. While Theora goes to make the video, all the mercenaries laugh and make plans for the arrival of the money and for Theora's demise.

: Best, Cheviot and Edison watch Theora's new tape. The new tape demands include twenty million credits in one hour to be exchange to an account via an irreversible computer bond device. Kurt arrives, is briefed and comments on the "professional" level of requiring an 'irreversible bond transaction at an undetermined location of their own choosing'. Cheviot has Murray obtain the bond transmitter as Bryce gets on the video link to say that he has found Theora and to not ask him how he did it. Kurt and Edison head off via helicopter to pick up the bond device and then to get to Theora's location as soon as possible. Kurt is deep in thought while flying the helicopter trying to think of an angle that won't get Theora killed but admits to Edison that she will probably be dead before they even arrive. Outside the featureless desert house the three mercenaries turn on Theora and announce to her that her usefulness has ended. Slauson grabs her rifle and drags her off to a rough firing range to kill her like a dog while the other two prepare to kill their visitors once the bond transaction has taken place. Borgia sends off to Best the location of the camp. Slauson roughly throws Theora down against the rough wall of a firing range and walks off a little before raising Theora's own rifle with which to blow her brains out. Theora looks numb and drained. Emotionless she watches as Slauson pulls the trigger. Click. Nothing. The weapon was not loaded. Slauson laughs and pulls out his own pistol. Theora begs briefly for her life but Slauson calls her a rich bitch and slaps her around a little. Slauson turns briefly to watch Edison's helicopter fly over. When Slauson turns back, Theora savagely bashes him in the head with a crude iron rod which was part of the crumbling wall. Slauson flops down to the ground - very dead. Theora picks up Slauson pistol, checks the load and expertly slams the clip home. Glancing around she moves swiftly and with purpose; with her back to the building she moves towards the helicopter and the terrorists.

: Meanwhile Edison, with Kurt pretending to be a pilot, has landed and has moved the bond device out towards the VFA mercenaries. He starts up the device and the credits begin quickly counting down on a digital readout as the electronic transaction takes places. Suddenly a shot rings out and the device is shattered as Theora is seen at the corner of the house. She covers all the VFA mercenaries and walks towards the helicopter. Billig tries to sneak out his pistol but Theora warns him: "Don't make me do what every fibre of me is longing to.." and has him throw the gun to the ground. Edison has a brief flashback to the Rakers episode as Theora says, "there's a lot I haven't told you about myself". Edison and Theora back up slowly to the helicopter. Theora is temporarily blinded by sweat and the desert sun as Billig dives for his pistol. Borgia takes a shot at Edison and then runs for the house. Kurt neatly kills Billig and then runs after Borgia. Theora in tears thanks Edison for being there. A shot rings out and Kurt is soon seen returning from the house. Kurt compliments Theora on her fine shot. Theora once again thanks Edison but bemoans the fact that her life will now never by the same since everyone will soon know her secret. "Find out what?" says Edison with a smile as Theora jubilantly throws her arms round his neck. Smiles all round as Murray links in to say that the Arctic War is over.

==''Max Headroom for President''==
In the immediate aftermath of the series cancellation, there was significant talk of a Max Headroom movie, which was to be rushed to completion both to capitalize on the shaky fan base and the looming US Presidential election. Steve Roberts and others spoke of it to the press and fan inquiries, and a few scant details beyond the title and obvious plotline are known.

Consider - just consider - the possibilities of:
# Big Time TV becoming really big-time, a global player, maybe because Max returned to them, and
# The pink bus mounted like a fighter jet outside corporate Big Time HQ, and
# Reg... in Armani.

Such a loss.</ns0:text>

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;If someone knows Max Headroom from just one thing, it's probably not the talk shows or the ABC series... it's the doomed campaign to sell "New Coke" to a market that had already rejected it once.&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:mhcom_coke_surf_poster.jpg|300px|thumb|right|There's a safety hazard here, somewhere...]]
I have decided not to try and fold the Coke material into the rest of the site. There's just too much of it and it's almost worth a site of its own.

Keep an aye-eye on this space, though: I intend to assemble a ''definitive'' look at the New Coke campaign in general and Max's heroic efforts on its behalf.

Yep... stay tu-tuned.</ns0:text>

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10511">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The ABC series was the playground of the show's art and graphics crew, who slipped a number of subliminal and surreptitious credits into the productions, as well as a few inside jokes. Here's the complete listing.&lt;/div&gt;

|}

In the ABC [[Episode ABC.1.1: "Blipverts" | pilot episode]], the first cut of the opening credits ends with an ad from Network 23 sponsor Zik-Zak: a fast-cut montage of fragmentary images, mostly showing an Asian man's face with various Zik-Zak logos fading in and out, and a bizarre combination of elements such as a bowl of cereal and a spark plug. It is hard to tell how this montage was meant to fit into the story, as it lies between the more formal opening credits and the formal start of the show with the "20 Minutes into the Future" fade-in. It is, however, meant to represent the "blipvert" so crucial to the plot, and may have simply been inserted to show off the work of the editors.

A shortened version of the montage was included in the opening credits of all following episodes. The original montage, in somewhat different form but composed of the same images, appeared in the original telefilm. (It is possible that the US crew reshot or recut the montage from original stills and animation sequences.)

Observant viewers may have thought they... saw something extra in this blinding slide show. They were right. If the sequence is viewed at slow speed, or frame by frame, names in a simple computer font appear, laid across the other visual elements. They are the names of the graphics crew, who in this era of television did not rate standard credits, and so felt free to add their own. The added names are found in five of the first-season episodes, but the joke (or hack) must have been spoiled during the hiatus, as no second-season episodes contain such inserts.

This list is authoritative and taken from the Shout! Factory DVD release, which was made from network broadcast masters. References to names appearing in other episodes may be due to fan/bootleg edits that put a clean set of opening credits from one episode on another; references to an absence of a name may be due to those frames being lost in a poor-quality or edited copy of an off-air recording.
The names last about seven frames each, and are quite noticeable at normal speed... ''if'' you know to watch for them.

===So Who ''Are'' These Guys?===
The shocking truth behind these embeds is that "Fred Raimondi" was actually "Blank Fred," who was tried in Video Court for this subtle "zipping" and reduced to component molecules for his crime. His cohorts were sentenced to a "life and a day," and some are still in prison regretting their deeds. Such is justice 20 minutes into the future.

Okay, seriously. 

'''Fred Raimondi''' is a very successful fx and title designer, still working in Hollywood. He is probably the primary architect of the dazzling ''Max Headroom'' opening credits, and used his position - and an entirely relevant sense of humor, and a bit of outrage at the lack of formal credits for his work in that era - to insert his name and those of some of the other digital creative artists in the high-speed edit.

His &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://fredraimondi.com/ web site]&lt;/span&gt; covers his long and distinguished career, but omits this ancient prank. Perhaps he'd prefer to forget it.

F-fat chance, Blank Fred. We remember. And grin.

(His seven-frame montage is the same in all uses. Two different representative frames have been included.)

'''Cliff Ralke''' died in 1992. His IMDb page lists him only as a cinematographer and omits any entry for ''Max Headroom''. It is likely that he did camera work on the fx or miniatures, which again was not credited in that transitional era.

'''Billy Fox''' is a producer and editor still &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0288886/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 working in Hollywood].&lt;/span&gt; It is unclear what his role might have been although he has some early work as an editor, especially video editing - which again would have been an uncredited role in those days.

'''Peter Sternlicht''' is a visual effects specialist also  still &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827993/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 working in Hollywood], mostly in visual compositing. He likely helped assemble many of the video-screen special effects and fill material.

'''Bill Stewart''' is... well, a Blank. There are more than twenty 'Bill Stewarts' listed in IMDb and three or four likely candidates among those who were editors or cameramen. Since he, too, would be uncredited for any work on ''Max Headroom'', there is no easy way to identify him among his clones.

Next time you groan at an endless list of TV or film credits, though, remember these five skilled workers and the many thousands of others who have never gotten recognition for their work, simply because "the book" didn't include rules for crediting their leading-edge efforts. And remember that these five ''did'' find a way to credit themselves.

And grin a little.

&lt;div class="inlinecite"&gt;I am indebted to the &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.spiritone.com/~brucem/trivmax.htm  '''early Max web page by Bruce Marcot''']&lt;/span&gt; that brought these "embeds" to wide attention, including mine. Bruce's page is still up, still full of amusing bits and worth a look.&lt;/div&gt;

==The Embedded Credits==
Not to confuse the terms, since I've used "embed" in the prior section, but the creative trolls that labored behind the scenes of ''Max Headroom'' didn't stop with a few names in the opening credits. Suspicious names are embedded throughout the screens of information, signs and even background audio of the episodes. It may be some time before all these brief mentions are catalogued. Those known now include:

* ''"John Smith Television"'' in a network ID in episode ABC.1.6, as well as ''"J. Smith TV"'' in a rating list shown in episode ABC.2.1. The commonality of the name might be the joke... but if it's meant to be a reference to a person, there are approximately 35,000 people with that name in the US alone. Finding the right JS could be a chore. There are two unlikely "J. Smith" possibilities in the minor show cast: J.W. Smith, who played the rickshaw cabbie Rik in three episodes, and J. Arlen Smith, who played  a nameless controller in at least one episode.

* "B. Stewart" as a co-author name in the title slide of Bryce Lynch's graduation project in episode ABC.1.6. Since Bill Stewart is one of the subliminal credits for this episode, a connection might be suspected.

* "B. Laramie" as a candidate in the telelection list of episode ABC.2.3. Bernie Laramie was the post-production supervisor for most of the series. Right below him is:

* "J. Rivers" as another candidate in the telelection list, and the eventual winner, flummoxing both Networks 23 and 66. There is no matching name in the known crew list, so a reference to comedienne Joan must be the answer. Or not.

==The Shash Slide==
[[File:Mh-abc11-place-slide-320.jpg|right|frame]]
Every episode of the series began in the same way, with a compressed form of the telefilm's dramatic beginning: the first thing viewers saw after the opening credits and first commercial break was a snowy screen with the sound of static, slowly fading into the opening scene. And, a moment later, the famous and brilliantly conceived "20 Minutes into the Future" slug.

Every episode but two, that is. The US series began, in Episode ABC.1.1, "Blipverts," with a black slide reading PLACE NETWORK COMMERCIAL HERE before cutting to the usual fade-in. It might have been a broadcast error, an affiliate station failing to cue in the program, unless you noticed the blinking "Network 23" logo. As an opening shock-joke, it works as an effective way to alert the audience that what they're about to watch is... not the same ol'.

[[File:Mh-abc16-shash-slide-320.jpg|right|frame]]
To further shake up the proles, episode ABC.1.6, "Blanks," began with the slide shown at right, which then quickly faded into the usual opening static. "NETWORK COMMERCIAL" is almost understandable, but...  "SHASH"? What was this?

At first, it looks like a compositing error - the "shash" slide being a placeholder for the fade-in static, with the substitution being forgotten before final output of the episode master. While it's possible for such errors to occur and even make it to air, that again doesn't explain the blinking Network 23 logo.

The truth was ferreted out from one of the show's creators: it was deliberate jape at the network (ABC, not Network 23). "Shash" is old BBC technical slang for screen garbage caused by poor editing or mistakes - a holdover from the RAF radar days of many of the original BBC television technicians, used to refer to noise and interference on their screens. Not to put it too delicately, the word is a composite of "sh*t" and "trash."

And, in the show source's explanation, that's a pretty good description of the inside of a network executive's skull. Max - the Max crew - had thumbed their noses right at the network brass again, and right in network prime-time.

==The Xenon Credit==
The miniature city used in the establishing shots throughout the series was built by a company called Image Engineering, and filmed by Xenon Productions. In many shots, especially in the second seasons, a building of moderate height, in between the Network 23 tower and the Art Deco-ish building that apparently holds Carter's apartment. has a bright green XENON logo nameplate.</ns0:text>

| class="mbtitle" colspan="3" | Max Headroom: A Biography from Two Worlds
|-
| class="mbleft" style="width:49%" | '''Max Headroom''' is an artificial personality, created by the head of Network 23's Research and Development Department, Bryce Lynch, and resident in Network 23's own corporate mainframe. He has essentially unlimited control of, and access to, all of Network 23's considerable communications powers. He is best known to the general public for breaking into network broadcasts with his own interpretations of the current program, advertising campaigns and reality as he perceives it through the network-wide Two-Way Analyzer. He can broadcast to the full range of Network 23 viewers or, through the Two-Way link, communicate with one or more of them. Viewers are often surprised to find themselves talking with - or being talked at by - the famous Max Headroom.

A few years ago, the global telecasting giant was experimenting with a new form of advertisement that compressed a full 30 seconds of images into 3. These "blipverts" allowed far more ad revenue through expansion of available commercial slots, but more importantly, they prevented channel-switching by viewers. The brief duration of the 'vert and its fascinatingly fast composition kept viewers on-channel, thus ensuring ratings.

Unfortunately, the blipverts had a peculiar effect on some viewers, related to the phenomenon of Spontaneous Human Combustion. Highly indolent viewers were physiological time bombs, and watching a blipvert could cause them to literally explode. At first, Network 23 exercised its considerable political power through its own security arm and its links to the city MetroCops, and covered up the explosions as microwave oven disasters.

It was the star of Network 23's own investigative show, "What I Want to Know," Edison Carter, who stumbled on the coverup and began investigating the true cause of the exploding citizens. With the assistance of his new controller Theora Jones, he pinned the problem on blipverts and uncovered the complicity of his own network's head of R&amp;D and its chairman Ned Grossman. Their attempt to further the coverup led to Carter finding himself the subject of an intense manhunt by both network security and MetroCops. During an escape attempt, his controller and R&amp;D head battled for control of the Network 23 building systems, locking and unlocking doors, forcing Carter's elevator to different floors and raising and lowering barriers. In a final valiant dash for the outside, Bryce Lynch was successful in raising a traffic barrier that caused Carter to launch his motorcycle into a traffic gate. By the time Theora Jones made it to the accident site, only the wreckage remained; Carter had vanished.

| class="mbright" style="width:49%" | '''Max Headroom''' is an entertainment figure created in 1985 at the behest of UK's Channel Four. Channel Four was a newcomer, launched in November 1982 to expand television options in the UK beyond BBC1, BBC2 and ITV. Unlike staid old "Auntie Beeb" and the mainstream ITV, Channel Four, with its relatively low power transmitters and charter to shake things up, took an independent, youth-oriented stance. By the time the channel was better-established in 1984, its operators wanted a music and video show much like rising cable/satellite star MTV.

Peter Wagg, a music producer with Chrysalis Records, was tapped to develop the idea. In concert with 
The early stages of development are not known, but the decision was made to look into a computer-generated host for such a show, whether it was real or simulated. It would not have taken long to determine that computer graphics and animation of the early 1980s were not up to such a task, at least, not without movie-level budgets and time. At some point, though, the project was approved and marketing man and science fiction aficionado George Stone was given the task of coming up with the host and a world he could represent. Blending punk, cyberpunk, Thatcher-era dystopian gloom, early ideas of computer animation and a host of traditional science fiction speculations, Stone crafted the birth certificate of Max Headroom, much as we came to know him after many iterations of change and development. Max, his bizarre humor and stuttering, blipverts, and general figure as a "talking head" all came from Stone's original treatment.

The treatment as written was not entirely suited to video and Channel Four use, so the directors, Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, along with producer Peter Wagg, reshaped the concepts into something that would fit the small screen. With such a complete backstory in hand, the idea arose of making a full-fledged introductory telefilm that could lead into Max's hosting of the video/music shows. Once again, the actual process is murky, but led to the one-hour debut of Max and his world on April 4. 1985.

A highlight of both earlier versions of this site was a dedicated forum for discussion of things Max. The first one was finally shut down because I couldn't keep up with the spam, bot and abuse users. The second one was part of the mega-wiki-ware and while it had a dedicated core of users, it was also hard to keep clear of garbage. It also got thrown out when I reclaimed 350MB of server space by deleting the platform.

There are no remaining forums for discussion of Max anywhere else. I'd be happy to restore one here if there's any sufficient level of interest. I like forums; they let a community have an extended, detailed, time-preserved discussion without comments and topics fading away.

'''So please... you came here for a reason. I need your input. Don't leave this page without leaving your completely anonymous vote!'''

If a forum dedicated to Max Headroom discussion was created here, I'd...
Be among the first to sign up and participate.
Probably sign up and participate.
Sign up and visit occasionally.
Lurk.
C-C-Care less. Or less-s-s-ser.

Further comments? Think there is another platform that would be better suited to Max discussion? '''[[C-C-Contact | Drop me a note]]''' and tell me your ideas. This will not happen without visitor input and support!</ns0:text>

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3713">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The ABC dramatic comedy series is by far the best known of Max's appearances. It ran for two short seasons in 1987, with leftover episodes seen as late as 1995.&lt;/div&gt;

(Summary and list to come. Data is available on other pages in the meantime.)

==Airing Information==
The first season of six episodes was shown on ABC as a late-season replacement in the spring of 1987. The second season ran that fall, but was cancelled after five episodes were shown. Two episodes were later shown as late-season filler, but the final episode was never seen until it ran on a cable channel in October of 1995. None of the episodes were ever re-run on ABC nor shown on any other channel until that 1995 showing.

Exact dates are not yet available, but the series was re-aired on Bravo in 1994-95, then again on the Sci-Fi (now the sickly and icky "SyFy") Channel in 1995-96, and finally on G4/Tech TV in 2002. The episodes circulated widely in pirate and bootleg copies taken from these showings until the authorized DVD set was finally issued by Shout! Factory in 2010.

===Viewing Order===
As with many shows produced - written, developed, shot, and edited - in one order and released or aired in another, there are inconsistencies in story development and continuity in the as-aired order of ''Max Headroom''.

Shows are aired out of production order for many reasons, the most common being that episodes with complex post-production needs aren't ready in time and a later but simpler ep is sent out to fill the schedule. Sometimes, the network or channel prefers a blockbuster or high-appeal episode to run during sweeps or ratings periods, or not to run when it might conflict with other programming. Two well-known examples in the TV science fiction genre are the Babylon 5 sequel, "Crusade" and the space western "Firefly," both of which were hampered by very irregular ordering of their episodes.

Both seasons of the ABC series had variance between the early production and airing sequence, and both variations may have contributed to the lackluster audience appeal. Although the show can be watched in almost any order - it does stem from the "closed episode" era, when shows were crafted to stand alone from episode and thus allow easy syndication packaging and lower demands on new audience members - it is best watched in linear order from first to last. That order can be the airing order, but in my opinion, it is best if viewed in production order instead:
#  [[Episode ABC.1.1: "Blipverts"]]
#  [[Episode ABC.1.3: "Body Banks"]]
#  [[Episode ABC.1.2: "Rakers"]]
#  [[Episode ABC.1.5: "War"]]
#  [[Episode ABC.1.6: "Blanks"]]
#  [[Episode ABC.1.4: "Security Systems"]] (leaving the best for the season last)
#  [[Episode ABC.2.3: "Grossberg's Return"]]
#  [[Episode ABC.2.2: "Deities"]]
#  [[Episode ABC.2.1: "Academy"]]
#  [[Episode ABC.2.4: "Dream Thieves"]]
...and the remaining four in order.

==Miscellany==

===Mark Snow's "Lost Theme"===

| class="links" | [[File:mhcom_youtube_icon_100.png|60px|link=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PInacZym0fY]]&lt;br /&gt;Mark Snow's "Lost Max Headroom Theme."
|} TV composer Mark Snow wrote a one-minute title theme that has been released on several of his compilation albums under the title "The Lost Theme from "Max Headroom'." I don't know anything about its history or whether it was ever seriously considered as the series theme, or just inspired Snow to turn his hand to a techo-beat sample piece.

I do have to say I like it a little more than the "official" theme - but I like the original, too.</ns0:text>

Now that I have polling capability installed, and it worked pretty well in inspiring me to go ahead and reactivate the [[Max Forum]], let's use it for other good purposes.

I have spent a lot of time in the last year refurbishing, restyling and re-platforming the site. In that time, I've filled in a lot of the data gaps. My time is less flexible these days, so I have to pick and choose what to work on.

'''This is your chance to tell me what you think is the priority of development work here.'''

Note that the poll will be updated from time to time, which will erase prior votes. Please do re-vote every time you see you have the chance. (Each poll will allow only one vote, so if it's letting you vote again... it's new.)

&lt;div class="lede"&gt;In his era and beyond, Max Headroom was virtually a standalone definition of every version of the word "video" - but his history ''on'' video is a puzzling mess.&lt;/div&gt;

Max ''is'' video. It's as simple as that. He was born into a fictional world where video is all, even most of reality... and he was created for an era when "videos" on the telly were the hottest market in all of media. In both cases, he ruled all he could see, and all those who could see him.

But in a pre-internet, pre-streaming, pre-OnDemand world, video could only exist in two forms: that which was broadcast or cabled to your set in realtime, or on hard, fragile and fairly primitive memory storage devices... VHS tapes. Which meant that someone had to produce them from TV shows and movies, and then sell them across counters like ham sandwiches.

Max had all the handicaps of being a television creation, which made him harder to package and sell in the expensive, short-duration recording era. Those limits put most TV shows well below true cinematic offerings from video rental stores and sales outlets. Television shows were only irregularly brought to VHS release because of cost considerations, since only four half-hour or two one-hour shows could be put on a single tape. The poster child for "classic home video" might be the earliest releases of ''Star Trek'', which made the uncut episodes of the original series available on some 45 tapes... at the original price of $30 each. It was obviously for rabid fans only.

In any case, both of Max's owners in the era swung for the extra income and exposure sales on videotape could bring. An educated guess says that only the original telefilm release brought any significant income, because of its wide appeal, international distribution and self-standing nature.

This page is likely to remain "Under Development" for quite some time, as the details about each video product are scanty and hard to validate. What follows is my best attempt - so far as each update goes - of the history and content of each release. However, I am fairly confident that only three sets of material were ever released prior to the 2010 release of the ABC series:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;The original UK telefilm, usually retitled as "The Original Story."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;The six first-season episodes of the ABC series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;A very rare compilation of highlights from the Channel Four/Cinemax talk shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

All other material found in private hands before 2010 was off-air recordings from the original broadcasts or otherwise bootleg. The second ABC season and the four seasons of talk/video shows were never formally released.

'''Contributions of validated data and video recording images are solicited to expand this page!'''

==''The Original Story'' (VHS &amp; LD)==
[[File:mhcom_mhtos_cover_f.jpg|200px|border|left|The US telefilm release.]] [[File:mhcom_mhtos_cover_r.jpg|200px|border|right|US telefilm release, rear cover.]]
By 1985, Chrysalis Productions had packaged the original telefilm and released it on videotape. Besides the obvious UK and US releases, which were widely sold and can still be found in up to near-mint condition on eBay and other resellers, there were almost certainly other releases in other countries - both of the repackaged English-language tape and of subtitled versions.

The US release is shown here, and is widely available from used tape resellers. I am still searching for a complete list and images of the international versions.

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
===...and the rare Laserdisc version===
[[File:mhcom_us_ld_tos_f.jpg|200px|border|left|The US telefilm release.]] [[File:mhcom_us_ld_tos_r.jpg|200px|border|right|US telefilm release, rear cover.]]
Given the scant penetration of the US market by laserdisc, it's no surprise that the US release of the origin telefilm on laserdisc is an extremely rare disc. (I've never actually see one, and I have yet to find an online specialty seller have one available for sale. The scarcity of this release was why the Japanese edition below was the more widely available, and sought, one.)
&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==The First ABC Season (VHS)==
By the end of the first season of the ABC series, Lorimar had packaged the first six episodes and through parent/partner RCA, released them in a number of international editions. The set consisted of three tapes, each with two episodes on them.

If any of the second season episodes were released by the original rights holders, there is no trace of them.

'''''You were warned!'''''
&lt;/div&gt;



Besides the US, UK, Norwegian and Japanese releases shown here, there are also references to a German release, which would make sense given the 1989 aftershock of [[Der Deutsch Max | German Maxness]]. I am also pretty sure I have seen other common language sets (Spanish, French, perhaps even Polish) but I haven't found any specifics yet.

He came ''so'' close to taking over the world...

==The Japanese Laserdiscs==
For reasons that are not clear but certainly revolve around (1) money; (2) the availability of rights to be sold; and (3) the rapid growth of the Japanese laserdisc market, there were a number of Max releases in Japan on high-quality laserdisc. I have never been able to establish a specific level of interest in Max Headroom from a purely Japanese audience, but some video resellers clearly thought it worth the effort to produce expensive and fragile pre-DVD discs for them.

For many years, these rare and expensive discs, which were not sold outside Japan (and could not be bought from authorized resellers for overseas delivery, making gray-market prices that much higher) and required costly players were the only way for Max fans to watch the material in high quality. Laserdiscs, like their immediate successor DVDs, delivered crystal-clear 480-line video, equivalent to the best broadcast standards.

===''The Original Story'' (Japanese Laserdisc)===
One of the prized possessions of Max fans in the long hiatus was a copy of this LD/DVD-quality version of the original telefilm, which could be purchased directly and new from a variety of sellers long after the other (US and UK) releases were out of print and rare.

This release was also used to make some of the very high-quality bootleg editions.


[[File:mhcom_jp_ld_tos_f.jpg|border|317px]]  [[File:mhcom_jp_ld_tos_r.jpg|border]]

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===The First ABC Season (Japanese Laserdisc)===
Japan was also the only country to get a high-quality release of the ABC series first season.

&lt;div class="itembreak_noline"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===The Best of Max Headroom (Japanese Laserdisc)===
This unusual and very rare laserdisc is believed to be the only authorized release of any of the video and talk show content. It consists almost entirely of excerpts from the interview segments, wrapped in a loose "single show" format with an opening and closing.

The list can be matched to the show listings. At some point, I'll do that.

==The Bootleg Era==
''Shh.'' Wait until those two undercover-cop types in the corner leave. Then we'll talk.

''Doo de-doo dah, dah-dah-dah... dum de dum dummm...'' So. Have you seen "The Grasshopper Lies Heavy" yet?

==Max Headroom: The Complete Series (DVD)==
[[File:mh_series_dvd_sf.jpg|border|240px|right]]
In 2010, Max finally came in from the Fringes and life among the Blanks with a studio-authorized, wholly legitimate release of the complete ABC series on DVD, with extras and features. Twenty-five years of waiting were rewarded with a very nicely packaged and produced set from Shout! Factory, one of the video houses that lovingly buys rights to and then makes available older, short and orphaned TV programs.

While the production and presentation of the material is superb (aside from the odd misspelling like "Whackets"), the video itself is a bit soft and dull. The discs were mastered from the only complete copies of the show available, broadcast tape masters. The original film versions are considered "lost" by their owner, All3Media - and whether that means lost as in "discarded or destroyed" or lost as in "we couldn't be arsed to search our giant warehouse of old Channel Four stuff for them" is an unanswered question. The masters were sufficiently close to original, uncut material that they preserved Edison Carter's completely not-safe-for-broadcast expletive in "Body Banks." Good enough, I guess.

The set is available from any reseller including Amazon.com at a very reasonable price. (In my opinion, fellow Blanks, if you ever owned a bootleg set of Max stuff, you really owe the system the cost of a legitimate set.) It includes all fourteen episodes in original edit, possibly pre-S&amp;P review (as above), and a full disc of extra material. It does not include the original telefilm, which along with all the previous material remains locked in All3Media's vaults for... someday.

I believe that my set, received shortly before the official release in August 2010, was sent to me as a promotional or review set, which I certainly appreciated. However, Shout! Factory has consistently failed to respond to inquiries and other correspondence from me over the years. Oh, well.

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2113">&lt;span class="lede"&gt;The evil head of Network 23 who prized ratings and profits over a few exploding viewers, and later became the chairman of rival network Network 66, was the only major character renamed between the telefilm and ABC series.&lt;/span&gt;

==Name Change==
In the telefilm, this character was simply known as Mr. Grosman, and played by Nickolas Grace. In the translation to American, he became Ned Grossberg. There are several reason why the name was changed... and more reasons why it wasn't changed to something else.

In 1986, the head of NBC's news division was the well-known Lawrence Grossman. While it's possible that Steve Roberts and the creative team behind the UK telefilm used his name knowingly, it was the opinion of Lorimar and ABC that making fun of a rival executive on US TV was a bad idea, and so Max ran into one of the first bluntings of his acid satire.

It is also possible that the character name changed to make it more euphonious... not with Ned (and perhaps Edward in some forgotten show note)... but with "Brandon." Brandon Grossman is an awkward name to say; Brandon Grossberg is a bit smoother. But Brandon, the original given name of this evil character, ran into the same lack of appreciation for industry satire as "Grossman." Brandon Tartikoff was the very well-known whiz-kid head of programming at NBC, who took over as president of the entertainment division (and thus had final say on programming) - and turned NBC from a last-place network to a powerhouse prime-time channel. Like "Grossman," "Brandon" was considered a little too close to home for ABC executive comfort.

So Nickolas Grace's glass-smooth "Mr. Grosman" became Charles Rocket's oily, eely "Ned Grossberg."

Which didn't stop rival ABC program "Sledge Hammer" from having an evil TV Executive who was not only named "Brandon Smartikoff" in their Max Headroom parody episode, but had it played by an actor who resembled Tartikoff.

Brandon Tartikoff, by the way, died just ten years later, at the very early age of 48, with a television career of more significance and influence than men decades older.</ns0:text>

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4023">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The first 12 episodes of The Max Headroom Show have yet to turn up in complete form. Although the site maintains a stub page for each episode in the hopes that such recordings might one day pass our way, or that the specific show from which known clips are taken will be identified, this page has been created to hold everything known in general about these "lost" shows until that time.&lt;/div&gt;
The original show was closer to other music video/VJ shows of the era on MTV, VH1 and similar cable channels, except that Max was allowed to get a little more bizarre than Martha Quinn, Nina Blackwood, Mark Goodman and others on the more "sensible" shows. (Using the term loosely.)

==Video==
[[File:mhcom_max_season_1.jpg|left|frame|Clip showing one version of the "lattice" background believed to be unique to Season 1. Most variations have a more pronounced "cell" look instead of straight lines.]]

{| style="margin: 8px 0 20px 20px;padding:2px;float:right;text-align:center;"

|}

This YouTube compilation is believed to be the only publicly-available (or otherwise known) video from Season 1 shows. It contains a number of Max quotes and skits mentioned elsewhere below.

The "latticework" background of slightly fuzzy, sparkly neon lines that change from "cells" to lines and uniformly change colors across the spectrum is believed to be unique to the first season. There are several variations, and at least one Season 1 clip has multi-colored lines but of the same fuzzy, sparkly neon look. Any clip of Max with these styles of background can be presumed to be from the first season until proven otherwise.

The better-known "bouncing colored box of lines," more finely drawn and with a less garish neon effect, indicates a clip from a Season 2 or later show. Again, as far as we know.

&lt;div style="clear:both;margin: 10px 0 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Audio==
We have a substantial collection of audio quotes from the Season 1 shows, from which selected examples will be posted here. Eventually.

&lt;div style="clear:both;margin: 10px 0 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Quotes==
The following Max quotes and quips are believed to be original from the first season, although some were reused as filler or re-performed in later shows. Unless noted, there is no data on which show they appeared within.

&lt;div class="quotes"&gt;

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "The Iran-Iraq War: Iran has issued a statement accusing Iraq over Iran's denial of Iraq's allegation that Iran has lied about Iraqi planes attacking Iran's positions on Iraqi territory claimed by Iran. Experts on both sides are studying the statement."

&lt;p class="quotenote"&gt;A classic, in the era of the the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) or any other time of Middle East strife... which is to say, a perennial classic. Re-used as filler in the [[Episode CMX.0.1: The Extended Origin Telefilm | Cinemax Extended Telefilm]].&lt;/p&gt;

* &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Max:&lt;/span&gt; "I reckon that all these high-rating T-T-T-TV-V-V-TV shows like 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty' are put on by the Russians. Think about it: there's two evenings a week when most of Britain and America are only looking on one direction, right? Straight at the TV, right? So who knows what's going on behind their backs, right? Now just think about what could go on if they show another royal wedding: it's the perfect time to strike. That's why I've come up with this plan: to make sure we're safe for at least half an hour a week, The Max Headroom Show is only going to show videos that the Russians will enjoy too."

&lt;p class="quotenote"&gt;Unfortunately, Max's plan failed in that 'Dynasty' was one of the two competing shows that doomed the ABC series to low ratings. Max would snipe at that show further in Seasons 2 and 3 as well. Re-used as filler in the [[Episode CMX.0.1: The Extended Origin Telefilm | Cinemax Extended Telefilm]].&lt;/p&gt;

      <ns0:text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1977">&lt;div class="lede"&gt;The talk, interview and video show created for Channel Four was Max's original purpose, and spanned some thirty installments between early 1985 and early 1987.&lt;/div&gt;

The show consisted of three seasons:
* A video-only show that ran 13 episodes on Channel Four in early 1985, with Max as presenter and wisecrack artist. These episodes were never shown on US television and there is very little data about the content available. The 13th and last show was a crossover to the second season format, with the first interview (of Sting).
: A [[Season 1 Summary | summary page of known skits and other details]] for the first 12 shows has been created as an info-placeholder.
* A video and talk show with a small "bar room" set that ran 6 episodes in fall 1985. Max introduced videos, did comedy riffs and in four shows, interviewed prominent musical guests. These shows, some of which reused material from the first season, were repeated on Cinemax in November and December 1985.
* An expanded video and talk show with a large set that ran 10 episodes, first on Cinemax from August to December 1986, and then repeated on Channel Four from January to March 1987.

===Third Season Title Credits===
The of-the-era video-style opening credits used for the third season flash a number of grotesque caricatures of celebrities, most from Max's era but a few older ones as well. Many are American celebrities, reinforcing the idea that the show was meant, in part, to be a parody of American TV. With reasonable assurance, the celebrities portrayed are:

:# Lucille Ball
:# Johnny Rotten (John Lydon)
:# Mr. T.
:# Mick Jagger
:# Marilyn Monroe
:# Woody Allen
:# Dame Edna (Barry Humphries)
:# Ronald Reagan
:# Princess Diana
:# Michael Caine
:# Bob Marley
:# Charlie Chaplin
:# Prince Charles
:# Ray Dorset  (Mungo Jerry) ?
:# Phil Silvers (as Sgt. Bilko)
:# Queen Elizabeth

&lt;div class="castcrew_title"&gt;Cast, Crew or C-Creative?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="textbold"&gt;Were you a part of the Max phenomenon?&lt;/span&gt;

A cast member, even a minor one?

Crew on any of the shows?

Creative who developed anything from dialogue to the entire Coke campaign?

I've connected with many of you; if you're not among those, I'd truly love to hear from you. Even a few comments and questions can add important material to the Project archives. I'm happy to give you your additional (or perhaps first!) due recognition, or put the material under "off the record," or any combination.

&lt;span class="textbold"&gt;[[C-C-Contact | Drop me a note, right now]]... and thanks!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This site has existed in one form or another since the beginning of the internet, and there appear to be some precursor file repositories and forums that extend right back to Max's era in the late 1980s. Mindful of that long legacy, I am proud to have this site be the last major stronghold of "things Max" on the web. While the rebuild and refresh and expansion onto this new platform are largely complete, you'll still run into a few unfinished pages and dead ends - I'm working on them, when I have time. As Max would say, "S-S-Sorry. Stay tun-tuned!"

{| class="t_links_l maxhello"
| Wait! ''W-wait!'' Max wants to say hello...

The overall organization is complete, but there is ''much'' still to come in content and style. The goal remains the same as always: to gather together in one place every relevant detail about Max, his world and his many appearances. More than that, the purpose here is to validate all that data and strip out the endless errors, mistakes, omissions and guesses, so that what remains here is complete, reliable and, I would hope, moderately interesting to all Max fans and scholars. This year, I hope to add in the missing element - you! - with a return of the discussion forums.

The new wiki platform makes it easy to browse and wander. Feel free to jump in anywhere and follow the connections where they take you. The top-level indexes and entry points are [[#InfoBanks | above]].

Welcome to the Max Headroom Chronicles... v3.0/2016 and continuing.

&lt;div class="sig"&gt;— I'm your host as both MaxRchives curator and site proprietor, [[C-C-Contact|Blank James]]. Enjoy your visit!&lt;/div&gt;</ns0:text>
